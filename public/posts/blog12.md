Mass immigration in Canada has its advantages and disadvantages; assimilation led to Canadians adopting Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Acupuncture adoption in Montreal began with British Columbia adding acupuncture to the [Canadian Medical Services Plan in 2008](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25555597/). Ontario and British Columbia have the highest adoption of acupuncture among the ten provinces of Canada. Regulation in Canada varies among provinces. For instance, [chiropractors can use acupuncture everywhere but in British Columbia and Quebec](https://acupuncturecanada.org/acupuncture-101/regulation-and-education/#:~:text=Medical%20doctors%20and%20dentists%20may,but%20Quebec%20and%20British%20Columbia). British Columbia has the most regulations regarding acupuncture practice. Acupuncture Edmonton, in Alberta, is another great place for holistic practitioners in Canada to include acupuncture in their practice.

Healthcare in Canada is challenged in many areas; adding holistic practices like acupuncture can help address some of these issues. Although it is not as popular as other cities in Canada, Montreal has several great options for people seeking acupuncture treatment. For example, practitioner [Xiao Lei Wang](https://acupuncture-clinic.ca/) practices moxibustion and cupping ("fire suckers").

Acupuncture in Montreal grew alongside the acupuncture boom in Ontario. Canada has seen an influx of Chinese immigrants and culture, which has contributed to the mass adoption of TCM and acupuncture.
