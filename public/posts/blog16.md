## Rosa centifolia (Provence Rose)

*Rosa centifolia* is one of the few plants without an exact habitat. Conversely, it is found in the wild and apparent in many habitats worldwide. It is important to note that the rose oil stems from the petals.

The study took place in Iran, and the most abundant element in the oil was "β-citronellol (14.5-47.5%)". Among 772 participants, studies "indicate that rose oil showed immediate changes in physiology—skin changes, blood pressure, blood flow, brain activity, and muscle tension." One study indicated that inhalation of rose oil improved renal colic symptoms in patients. Amongst all the studies, rose oil has the strongest analgesic and anti-depressant effects.
