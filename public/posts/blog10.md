# The Curious Case of Cancer: Everyday Fruit for Prevention

[Cancer Cases, Deaths in Men Predicted to Surge by 2050](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/cancer-cases-deaths-men-predicted-surge-2050-2024a1000frl?form=fpf). Currently, cancer is responsible for 1 in 5 deaths in the world. There is no cure for cancer, and statisticians expect cancer deaths to rise. What if the cure to cancer is found in the foods we eat? The number one fast food chain in the world is McDonald’s. [Canola oil was first created in the early 1970s as a natural oil. But in 1995, Monsanto created a genetically modified version of canola oil. By 2009, over 90 percent of the Canadian canola oil crop was genetically engineered. Dr. Sebi theorized that seed oils are carcinogenic once heated.](https://www.fuckcancer.org/canolaoilhealthrisks/) Let’s explore the relationship between food, cancer, and fruits with powerful preventive properties.

Veganism is steadily criticized online. The Standard American Diet has convinced Americans that mass consumption of dairy and meat is paramount to health. [African Americans are more prone to prostate cancer (and general cancer) than any other race.](https://zerocancer.org/black-men#:~:text=Black%20and%20African%20American%20men,prostate%20cancer%20than%20white%20men.) Ironically, African Americans consume more meat than other races. Researchers, Nutritionists, and Herbalists universally agree that disease stems from deficiency. Star athletes like Chris Paul and Serena Williams show that plant-based diets support high performance. Future Hall of Fame quarterback Tom Brady eats “80% plant-based, 20% animal-based”. Diets high in meat and dairy do not provide the necessary vitamins and nutrients that plants do. Moreover, all pharmaceuticals have a plant root.

How many times have you eaten an apricot seed? Dr. Ernst T. Krebs Jr. found that cancer stems from a deficiency in a compound in the nitriloside family, specifically the Prunus Rosacea family: apricot seeds, blackthorn, bitter almonds, peaches, plums, cherries, and nectarines. Apricot seeds have a high amount of nitrilosides. At the Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, researcher Dr. Kanematsu Sugiura found five results: 

1. Laetrile stopped metastasis (cancer spreading) in mice.  
2. Improved general health.  
3. Inhibited growth of small tumors.  
4. Provided relief from pain.  
5. Acted as cancer prevention.  

Roasted apricot seeds have not shown a poisonous effect. Cases of cyanide poisoning are rare and multi-faceted. Societies consuming high amounts of apricot seeds tend to have lower cancer rates.

[World Without Cancer: The Story of Vitamin B17](https://blog.dana-farber.org/insight/2022/01/which-countries-have-the-highest-and-lowest-cancer-rates/) describes the Hunza tribe eating 30–50 apricot seeds per sitting, living on average 120 years. B17 is banned in the United States, where the average lifespan is 77–78 years. Traditional Eskimo diets high in nitrilosides showed similar protective effects. Countries like India have lower cancer rates due to plant-based diets. [Sudan has the lowest cancer rates in the world.](https://blog.dana-farber.org/insight/2022/01/which-countries-have-the-highest-and-lowest-cancer-rates/)

B17 contains two units of glucose, one of benzaldehyde, and one of cyanide (beta-glucosidase). The unlocking enzyme is safe for the body but kills cancer cells. Traditional medicine focuses on chemotherapy, whereas natural medicine focuses on addressing root causes. B17 stimulates hemoglobin, destroys cancer cells, nourishes non-cancer cells, and can help with sickle-cell anemia.

The FDA banned Laetrile in 1980, three years after Dr. Sugiura noted its potential. The major reason is potential cyanide poisoning. Roasted seeds destroy the unlocking enzyme. Cigarettes, alcohol, seed oils, and artificial dyes are toxic but not banned in the same way. Politics, industry influence, and regulation have affected cancer treatments.

For those without access to B17 in the US, Canada, Australia, or Europe, black raspberries and figs are suggested for prevention. Black raspberries have high antioxidants and anthocyanins; figs contain fig latex, a strong anti-cancer agent. [Study shows fig latex has anti-cancer effects on liver and brain cancers.](https://www.nutripanda.com/fighting-cancer-series-bless-figs#:~:text=The%20study%20shows%20that%2C%20in,on%20liver%20and%20brain%20cancers.)

Chemotherapy is responsible for deaths in over 25% of patients. [A New Zealand study](https://www.ejcancer.com/article/S0959-8049(16)32023-8/abstract#:~:text=Findings%3A%20We%20identified%20931%20deaths,all%20deaths%20under%20our%20service.) reported 43 deaths within 30 days of chemotherapy, representing 6% of treated patients.

Natural cancer treatments by [Harry Hoxsey](https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/howard-hoxsey-natural-cancer-cures/) and [Max Gerson](https://gerson.org/) are practiced in Mexico today. B17 is available in Mexico, and cancer death rates are 37% that of the US. Poor record-keeping affects statistics. Controversy arises over treatment vs. prevention, but apricot seeds, black raspberries, and figs have undeniable medicinal properties.
