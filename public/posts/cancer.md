# Vitamin B: Vitamin B17 – The Mysterious Case of Cancer

B vitamins convert food into energy and help strengthen the immune system. The vitamin B Complex is a mixture of various B vitamins:

- **B6 (Pyridoxin)**: Essential for red blood cell health. Not naturally produced by the body; found in pasilla and ancho peppers, sunflower seeds, and whey protein isolate.  
- **Vitamin B12**: Converts carbohydrates and fats into energy for proteins. Deficiency can result in multiple health issues, including cancer, anemia, fatigue, neurological problems, and joint pain. Found in clams, oysters, mussels, crabs, and sardines.  

**Vitamin B17 (Laetrile)** is the most controversial B vitamin. According to [*World Without Cancer: The Story of Vitamin B17*](https://www.amazon.com/World-Without-Cancer-Story-Vitamin/dp/0912986506) by G. Edward Griffin, “Vitamin B17 (Laetrile) can destroy cancer cells.” This article explores Laetrile’s components, the book’s claims, and why B17 is illegal in the United States.

## Natural Alternatives and Nutritional Insights

- Dr. Sebi argued against consuming cooked oils like palm or soybean oil. Instead, oils extracted from American Palm or Batana nuts are rich in antioxidants and vitamin E.  
- The Tawira tribe, known as “people of beautiful hair,” attributes their hair health to batana oil, paired with a vegetarian diet for maximum results.

## Historical Research on Laetrile

- Dr. Sugiura and Dr. Lloyd Schloen conducted studies on mice with Laetrile, with mixed results on tumor growth suppression.  
- Laetrile was found to have **no preventive, tumor-regressing, or curative anti-cancer activity** in traditional medical studies.

## What is Laetrile?

- In 1952, Dr. Ernst T. Krebs Jr. theorized that some cancers stem from deficiencies in the nitroloside family, prevalent in fruits from the *Prunus Rosacea* family: bitter almond, apricot, blackthorn, cherry, nectarine, peach, and plum.  
- He called the compound **vitamin B17**. The theory: proper nutrition can empower the body to fight disease naturally.

Dr. George M. Briggs (Professor of Nutrition, University of California) noted:  
> “The typical American diet is a national disaster. Without supplements, disease rises, while populations with nutrient-rich diets, like the Hunza people of Pakistan, live longer.”

- The Hunza tribe emphasizes vitamin A and whole-food nutrition. Their plant-based, nitriloside-rich diet contributes to exceptional longevity.  
- In contrast, the U.S. diet prioritizes taste over nutrition, with more fast-food chains than farmer’s markets.

## Mechanism and Controversy

- Vitamin B17 contains two units of glucose, one of benzaldehyde, and one cyanide (beta-glucosidase).  
- According to Griffin and Krebs, the unlocking enzyme targets cancer cells without harming healthy cells.  
- Traditional medicine disagrees with efficacy claims; mainstream medicine favors chemotherapy and views Laetrile as potentially toxic.  
- The FDA banned Laetrile in 1980 due to cyanide concerns. Dr. Krebs argued that roasting seeds destroys the enzyme and discredits B17.

## Nutrition and Disease Prevention

- Disease stems from deficiencies in vitamins B, A, D, E, and K.  
- B17 (Laetrile) is primarily found in bitter almond, apricot, blackthorn, cherry, nectarine, peach, and plum.  
- Healthy adults are recommended to get at least **50 mg of B17 daily**.  
- While Laetrile is illegal in the U.S., alternative treatments in Mexico and other countries use it.
