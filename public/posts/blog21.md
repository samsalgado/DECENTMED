# Acupuncture for Migraines

## How Acupuncture Works

Acupuncture is a **traditional Chinese medicine practice** that inserts thin, sterile needles into specific points on the body called acupoints, which correspond to energy pathways called meridians. These are believed to regulate the flow of vital energy, or “qi,” throughout the body.

For migraine treatment, acupuncture works through several mechanisms:

- **Pain modulation:** Stimulating specific points triggers the release of endorphins, the body’s natural painkillers.  
- **Inflammation reduction:** Helps decrease inflammatory markers associated with migraine attacks.  
- **Nervous system regulation:** Balances the autonomic nervous system, reducing stress and tension.  
- **Blood flow improvement:** Enhanced circulation can prevent vascular changes that contribute to migraines.  

## The Science Behind Acupuncture for Migraines

Recent clinical research supports acupuncture as an effective migraine treatment. Multiple studies have shown that regular sessions can:

- Reduce migraine frequency by up to **50%** in many patients.  
- Decrease the intensity and duration of attacks.  
- Lower the need for pain medications.  
- Improve overall quality of life for chronic migraine sufferers.  

## Common Acupuncture Points for Migraine Relief

While treatment is individualized, practitioners commonly target these points:

- **LI4 (Hegu):** Located on the hand, effective for frontal headaches.  
- **GB20 (Fengchi):** Base of the skull, helps with tension and pain.
