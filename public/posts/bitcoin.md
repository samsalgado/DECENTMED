# What is Bitcoin?

Bitcoin is more than just digital money—it's a **new way to transact person-to-person** without relying on banks or intermediaries.

## The Concept

Imagine sending money directly from your phone to pay bills, security deposits, or even transferring funds to someone across the globe as if they were next door. Traditional systems are complicated, with multiple entities overseeing simple transactions. Bitcoin simplifies this process:

- **Decentralized:** No middleman needed.  
- **Self-sovereign:** You are your own bank.  
- **Digital:** Works seamlessly online, anywhere in the world.

### How Digital Currency Works

- According to the [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2022/06/29/covid-19-drives-global-surge-in-use-of-digital-payments#:~:text=Two-thirds%20of%20adults%20worldwide,2017%20and%2042%25%20in%202011):  
  > "2/3 of adults worldwide send or receive digital payments."  
- Bitcoin builds on this by removing centralized control. No bank can freeze your account or charge excessive fees.
