# Acupuncture: What You Need to Know

Acupuncture is an ancient practice rooted in Traditional Chinese Medicine that aims to **balance the body’s flow of energy, or “Qi,”** through specific points on the body. It has gained popularity as a holistic treatment for pain relief, stress reduction, and general wellness.  

## How Acupuncture Works

The acupuncture process generally involves four main steps:  

1. **Assessment:** The practitioner checks pulse, vitals, and identifies points of imbalance.  
2. **Needle Insertion:** Thin needles are inserted into acupuncture points where blood, lymph, and nerves can stimulate connective tissue.  
3. **Manipulation & Moxibustion:** Needles are sometimes manipulated to increase effectiveness, and moxibustion may be applied. Moxibustion involves burning mugwort herb to improve circulation and relieve stagnant or cold conditions.  
4. **Post-Care:** Topical patches or herbal rubs may be applied to enhance results.  

### Special Notes

- The **ear** is considered a microsystem for the entire body, with pressure points affecting areas like the neck, shoulders, and reproductive organs.  
- The **Buddha Triangle**, a set of three key points, is believed to reduce stress, anxiety, depression, and trauma.  
- Certain channels, like the **spleen channel**, connect strongly to women’s health points.
