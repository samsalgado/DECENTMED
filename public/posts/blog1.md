## How Constipation Affects the Body

- **Prevalence:**  
  - 80% of the population experiences significant back pain at some point.  
  - 15% of Americans struggle with chronic constipation ([NIH](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/constipation)).  
- **Mechanism:** Stool buildup can put pressure on the **sacral nerve**, which controls motor function in the pelvic region, bowels, and bladder. This pressure can lead to **lower back pain**.

## Diet, Fiber, and Lifestyle

- **The Standard American Diet (SAD):** High in fats, dairy, oils, sugars, grains, and artificial sweeteners.  
- **Lactose Intolerance:** 65% of the global population is lactose intolerant ([Source](https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/lactose-intolerance/#:~:text=Approximately%2065%20percent%20of%20the,people%20affected%20in%20these%20communities)).  
- **Fiber Deficiency:** A major contributor to constipation.  
  - Eat more fiber-rich foods like:  
    - Pears, strawberries, avocados  
    - Oats, raspberries, prunes  

> Many athletes and celebrities—Serena and Venus Williams, Diana Taurasi, Nate Diaz, Tom Brady, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and LeBron James—follow plant-based diets high in fiber.

## Obesity, Acidic Foods, and Constipation

- Obesity is linked to **over 60 chronic diseases** in the U.S.  
- Acidic foods (dairy, processed foods, fatty oils) can exacerbate digestive issues.  
- Dr. Sebi advocated for **alkaline foods** to create an environment where disease cannot thrive.  

> Regular exercise, hydration, and a diet rich in fruits and vegetables can help alleviate constipation.

## Treatments and Prevention

- **Dietary adjustments:** Increase fiber, reduce processed and acidic foods.  
- **Exercise:** Keeps the digestive system active.  
- **Fasting & Water Detox:** Gives the digestive system a rest (consult your doctor).  
- **Enemas:** Can help remove toxins and relieve constipation (doctor-led).  
- **Chiropractic care:** Supports the spine and sacral nerve function.  

> Remember, your body is an interconnected system—what you eat affects your entire body.
