- Restore cells to ketosis  
- Promote cellular rejuvenation  
- Support your body's natural healing process  

Detoxification is often used in holistic therapies, such as the [Gerson Therapy](https://gerson.org/) or [Dr. Sebi’s diet](https://drsebiscellfood.com/), which combine plant-based nutrition and detox methods to help remove toxins that may contribute to disease.
