## Holistic Medicine and Autism

Holistic medicine emphasizes treating the **whole person**, not just symptoms. Dr. Sebi and other herbalists estimate that roughly 80% of disease is linked to **diet and lifestyle**. The **Center for Natural Health** in St. Louis, Missouri, integrates multiple holistic modalities—homeopathy, acupuncture, chiropractic care, and neurology—to identify conditions often missed by conventional medicine.  

Dr. Amy Wicks uses **NAET** (Nambudripad's Allergy Elimination Techniques) to address various ailments, including **Autism spectrum disorders**.

### Dr. Amy Wicks’ Approach

Dr. Wicks is a **Board Certified Chiropractor with acupuncture certification**. She describes acupuncture as:

> "A type of alternative medicine that aids the body in healing."

The human body has **immense regenerative potential**, and treatments like acupuncture help **restore proper energy flow**. Traditional medicine often relies on medications that can weaken the immune system, whereas holistic treatments aim to **unblock and balance the body’s natural energy pathways**.

### Applied Kinesiology and Chiropractic for Autism

Dr. Wicks combines **chiropractic adjustments, applied kinesiology, and acupuncture** to support children with Autism. Key elements include:

- **Applied Kinesiology:** Uses the body’s own information to identify and correct imbalances. Addresses cranial faults, joint subluxations, and optimizes **GI system function**.  
- **Chiropractic Care:** Focuses on cranial and sacral bones that may not function properly in ASD children.  
- **Acupuncture:** Supports proper neuron formation and synapse development.  
- **Nutrition:** Ensures the body receives essential nutrients for optimal health.

This **multimodal approach** targets root causes of multisystem disorders like Autism, rather than only addressing symptoms.
