Acupuncture and dry needling are both techniques that involve needles, but their goals, methods, and philosophies differ.

## What is Acupuncture?

Acupuncture is a **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)** practice designed to balance the flow of energy, or **Qi**, throughout the body. Key points:  
- Works with the **body’s connective tissue** to influence brain chemistry and improve overall well-being.  
- Primarily used for **pain management**, stress relief, and holistic health.  
- Techniques include:  
  - **Needle insertion** into specific points  
  - **Acupressure** (manual pressure without needles)  
  - **Cupping** (using suction to stimulate muscles and skin)  
  - **Moxibustion** (burning herbs to stimulate circulation)  

> *“Increased blood flow equals increased healing time.”* – A common acupuncture principle.

## What is Dry Needling?

Dry needling is a **Western medical technique** targeting **musculoskeletal disorders**.  
- Focuses on relieving **trigger points** in muscles.  
- Types:  
  1. **Pistoning** – inserting the needle directly into the trigger point  
  2. **Muscle contraction** – inserting into the skin to stimulate muscle response  
- Mainly used for **pain, stiffness, and muscle recovery**, often in athletes.  
- Works **directly with anatomy**, unlike acupuncture, which follows energy pathways.

## Key Differences

| Aspect | Acupuncture | Dry Needling |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Philosophy | Energy balance (Qi) | Anatomical/muscle focus |
| Purpose | Pain relief, holistic health | Muscle pain and stiffness |
| Technique | Specific points, varied techniques | Trigger points, pistoning or muscle contraction |
| Side Effects | Minimal, works with body | Minimal if done by a practitioner |

Both techniques are **safe when performed by trained professionals** and offer alternatives to pharmaceuticals, which may disrupt brain chemistry or have side effects.
