[![Visit Apothecary](batana)](/apoth)

Hepatitis B is a liver infection caused by HBV and transmitted through another infected person’s blood, semen, or other fluids. It affects the liver and can be more severe in children than in adults. The liver has five major functions: metabolism, immunity, digestion, detoxification, and vitamin storage. *(Disclaimer: not medical advice)* Currently, there is no cure for Hepatitis B. This article explores plants with potential benefits for supporting liver health and fighting Hep B.

*Portulaca grandiflora*  
A vibrant pink flower from South America (Brazil), Portulaca grandiflora—also known as rose moss—is considered **depurative**, meaning it helps detoxify the body. Herbalists believe detoxification and diet shifts are essential before healing begins. Dr. Max Gerson emphasized green diets and [coffee enemas](https://gerson.org/coffee-enema-8-things-you-need-to-know/?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwrKu2BhDkARIsAD7GBou-t43MHZkA6SM-wjvUkmRmEzwQmXIXOxDcZGRzQpRiFIJbC_TWLgYaAgZtEALw_wcB) to detoxify the liver, a principle similarly applied to Hep B. Studies from 1990 indicate the plant has an [“antimutagenic effect on mutations induced by aflatoxin B1 and cyclophosphamide in mice”](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378874103004057#:~:text=Portulaca%20grandiflora%20was%20reported%20for,et%20al.%2C%201990).

*Cordydalis yanhusuo*  
A fuchsia flower native to China, this plant has long been used to [“invigorate the blood”](https://pfaf.org/USER/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Corydalis+yanhusuo). Blood passing through the liver is crucial for nutrient metabolism. Corydalis yanhusuo supports abdominal pain relief and possesses antitussive, cardiotonic, hypotensive, and anticancer properties.

*Blighia sapida*  
Originating from West Africa (Côte d’Ivoire), this plant is traditionally consumed when fully ripe and used to treat [yellow fever, epilepsy, and edema](https://pfaf.org/User/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Blighia+sapida). The plant aids digestion, helping counteract nausea and vomiting associated with Hep B. The twigs of the plant have also been used to support hepatitis, cirrhosis, and amygdalitis.

Herbalists believe disease stems from deficiency and nutrition. Applying these plants aligns with liver functions: Portulaca grandiflora detoxifies and fights tumor mutations, Cordydalis yanhusuo cleanses the blood, and Blighia sapida supports digestion. Holistic medicine views the body as interconnected; integrating these plants may help maintain liver health. *(Not medical advice)*
