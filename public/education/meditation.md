### Getting Started with Meditation
- **Start Small**: Begin with just a few minutes each day.  
- **Find a Comfortable Space**: Choose a quiet, distraction-free environment.  
- **Focus on Your Breath**: Anchor your mind by noticing your breathing.  
- **Be Kind to Yourself**: It’s normal for the mind to wander—gently return focus without judgment.
