# Homeopathy

Seeking Homeopathy doctors near me? Homeopathy is a system of alternative medicine developed in the late 18th century by German physician **Samuel Hahnemann**. It is based on the principle of *“like cures like”*—meaning that a substance that causes symptoms in a healthy person can be used in highly diluted form to treat similar symptoms in someone who is ill.  

Homeopathy is considered safer and has shown benefits for a wide range of diseases and ailments. In this video, Dr. Tim Shannon discusses off-label drugs in cancer treatments and the role of Homeopathy in treating ADD.
