# Mindset Coaching

A mindset coach helps you gain a deeper understanding of who you really are. By learning the science of achievement and the science of the mind, you can create change at the root cause—change that lasts.  

I’m Priscilla, a mindset coach passionate about helping individuals and entrepreneurs understand the transformative power of their mindset and how it directly impacts their results in all areas of life. My mission is to help you create your life by design.
