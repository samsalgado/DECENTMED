# Functional Medicine

Functional Medicine takes a holistic approach to health by focusing on the root causes of illness rather than just treating symptoms. It emphasizes the importance of lifestyle, nutrition, and daily habits in achieving long-term wellness. A thorough evaluation of diet, exercise, and routines helps create personalized strategies for healing and prevention.

Dr. Nadia Taylor, inspired by her own journey of healing through holistic medicine, opened **Essence of Life** in Boynton Beach, Florida in September 2025. Her mission is to help others overcome disease and live healthier lives using the same modalities that transformed her health. After years away, she is excited to return to South Florida and is dedicated to serving her community with compassion and care.
