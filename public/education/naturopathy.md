# Naturopathy

Naturopathy is a holistic approach to healthcare that emphasizes the body’s innate ability to heal itself using natural therapies and lifestyle changes. It aims to address the root cause of illness rather than just managing symptoms.  

### Homeopathy vs Naturopathy
Homeopathy is based on the principle of *“like cures like”*, meaning that a substance that causes symptoms in a healthy person can be used in highly diluted form to treat similar symptoms in someone who is ill.  

Conversely, Naturopathy focuses on natural healing through diet, lifestyle, and therapies. According to the CDC, prescription overdoses are expected to exceed 80,000 in 2025, making naturopathic medicine a safer and more effective alternative for many individuals.
