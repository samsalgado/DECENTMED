# Acupuncture

Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) technique that involves inserting thin needles into specific points on the body. There are 12 primary meridians in the body, and acupuncturists stimulate the meridians with the points to activate the body's natural healing processes.

The process of acupuncture is a four-step process beginning with checking the pulse and other vitals. Then, needles are inserted into acupuncture points or points where blood, lymph, and nerves can easily access connective tissue. Next, the needles are manipulated, and sometimes moxibustion is applied. Moxibustion is a traditional Chinese medical technique that involves burning the herb mugwort to relieve cold or stagnant conditions by stimulating circulation. Finally, topical patches and herbal rub are applied to the post-need injection sites.

An estimated 66% of people have some form of corporate burnout. According to the WHO, "at least 70% of people have some form of trauma." Acupuncture lowers cortisol levels; studies have shown that it stimulates the vagus nerve — helping with trauma, corporate burnout, and more.
