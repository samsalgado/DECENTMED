It is also used to treat sore nipples[213] and is said to be one of the best curatives for a sore throat[245]. The buds, resin, and/or sap are used in folk remedies for treating cancers, corns, and warts[269]. The resin is also antiscorbutic, diaphoretic, diuretic, stimulant and tonic[4, 171, 222]. It is used internally in propriety mixtures to treat coughs and diarrhoea, though taken in excess it is purgative[238]. A warm liquid of the gummy sap was drunk as a treatment for gonorrhoea[212]. A tea made from the leaves is antiscorbutic[4, 171]. It is used in the treatment of coughs, colds and fevers[222]. The leaves and young shoots are best harvested in the spring and dried for later use[238]. This plant was widely used medicinally by various North American Indian tribes[257].

Some caution should be employed in the use of this species since it can possibly cause skin irritations. It is best only used under the supervision of a qualified practitioner. A tea made from the bark or root bark is alterative, antiseptic, astringent, galactogogue, haemostatic, rubefacient and tonic[4, 222, 238, 257]. It is used in the treatment of diarrhoea, fevers, general debility, sore mouths, rectal bleeding, uterine prolapse etc[222, 254]. It is used as a gargle to treat sore throats and applied externally to treat excessive vaginal discharge, burns and skin eruptions[254, 257]. The powdered bark can be applied as a poultice to old ulcers, it is a good antiseptic[4]. A tea made from the roots is appetizer, astringent, diuretic and emetic[222, 257]. An infusion is used in the treatment of colds, sore throats, painful urination, retention of urine and dysentery[257]. The root is harvested in the autumn and dried for later use[254]. An infusion of the green or dried branches has been used in the treatment of TB[257]. A decoction of the branches, with the seed heads, has been used to treat itchy scalps and as a bathing water for frost-bitten limbs[257]. The milky latex from the plant has been used as a salve on sores[257]. A tea made from the leaves was used in the treatment of asthma, diarrhoea and stomatitis[222].

Some caution should be exercised in the use of this herb since large or frequent doses taken over a long period may be potentially harmful[222], causing allergic rashes and making the skin more sensitive to sunlight[238]. The herb combines well with Sambucus nigra flowers (Elder) and Mentha x piperita vulgaris (Peppermint) for treating colds and influenza[268].

A tea made from the leaves has traditionally been used as a cleansing tonic and blood purifier so the plant is often used in the treatment of hay fever, arthritis, anaemia etc[254]. The whole plant is antiasthmatic, antidandruff, astringent, depurative, diuretic, galactogogue, haemostatic, hypoglycaemic and a stimulating tonic[4, 9, 21, 36, 165, 238]. An infusion of the plant is very valuable in stemming internal bleeding[4], it is also used to treat anaemia, excessive menstruation, haemorrhoids, arthritis, rheumatism and skin complaints, especially eczema[238]. Externally, the plant is used to treat skin complaints, arthritic pain, gout, sciatica, neuralgia, haemorrhoids, hair problems etc[238]. The fresh leaves of nettles have been rubbed or beaten onto the skin in the treatment of rheumatism etc[257]. This practice, called urtification, causes intense irritation to the skin as it is stung by the nettles. It is believed that this treatment works in two ways. Firstly, it acts as a counter-irritant, bringing more blood to the area to help remove the toxins that cause rheumatism. Secondly, the formic acid from the nettles is believed to have a beneficial effect upon the rheumatic joints. For medicinal purposes, the plant is best harvested in May or June as it is coming into flower and dried for later use[4, 238]. This species merits further study for possible uses against kidney and urinary system ailments[222]. The juice of the nettle can be used as an antidote to stings from the leaves and an infusion of the fresh leaves is healing and soothing as a lotion for burns[4]. The root has been shown to have a beneficial effect upon enlarged prostate glands[254]. A homeopathic remedy is made from the leaves[4]. It is used in the treatment of rheumatic gout, nettle rash and chickenpox, externally is applied to bruises[4]. The German Commission E Monographs, a therapeutic guide to herbal medicine, approve Urtica dioica Stinging Nettle for rheumatic ailments (internal use of leaf), irrigation therapy, for inflammatory disease of the lower urinary tract and prevention of kidney (gravel) formation, urination difficulty from benign prostatic hyperplasia (root) (see [302] for critics of commission E).',

In Ayurveda it is highly valued as a rejuvenator for the brain and nervous system and as a remedy for digestive disorders[254]. However, some care should be taken in its use since some forms of the plant might be carcinogenic - see the notes above on toxicity for more information. The root is anodyne, aphrodisiac, aromatic, carminative, diaphoretic, emmenagogue, expectorant, febrifuge, hallucinogenic, hypotensive, sedative, stimulant, stomachic, mildly tonic and vermifuge[4, 7, 9, 21, 147, 165, 213, 240, 279]. It is used internally in the treatment of digestive complaints, bronchitis, sinusitis etc[238]. It is said to have wonderfully tonic powers of stimulating and normalizing the appetite. In small doses it reduces stomach acidity whilst larger doses increase stomach secretions[254] and it is, therefore, recommended in the treatment of anorexia nervosa[244]. However if the dose is too large it will cause nausea and vomiting[K]. Sweet flag is also used externally to treat skin eruptions, rheumatic pains and neuralgia[238]. An infusion of the root can bring about an abortion[213] whilst chewing the root alleviates toothache[213]. It is a folk remedy for arthritis, cancer, convulsions, diarrhoea, dyspepsia, epilepsy etc. Chewing the root is said to kill the taste for tobacco[218]. Roots 2 - 3 years old are used since older roots tend to become tough and hollow[4]. They are harvested in late autumn or early spring and are dried for later use[4]. The dry root loses 70% of its weight, but has an improved smell and taste[244]. It does, however, deteriorate if stored for too long[244]. Caution is advised on the use of this root, especially in the form of the distilled essential oil, since large doses can cause mild hallucinations[192]. See also the notes above on toxicity. A homeopathic remedy is made from the roots[9]. It is used in the treatment of flatulence, dyspepsia, anorexia and disorders of the gall bladder[9]. Bath oils containing calamus have caused redness of the skin (erythema) and dermatitis, particularly in hypersensitive individuals [301].',

This plant is potentially toxic if ingested and should not be used internally without professional supervision[254]. Alterative, analgesic, haemostatic and vulnerary[165, 218]. The bark is anti-inflammatory, astringent, diuretic, febrifuge, narcotic, tonic and vasoconstrictive[4, 7, 222]. It is harvested in the spring and dried for later use[4]. The plant is taken in small doses internally for the treatment of a wide range of venous diseases, including hardening of the arteries, varicose veins, phlebitis, leg ulcers, haemorrhoids and frostbite[238, 254]. It is also made into a lotion or gel for external application[254]. A tea made from the bark is used in the treatment of malaria and dysentery, externally in the treatment of lupus and skin ulcers[4, 222]. A tea made from the leaves is tonic and is used in the treatment of fevers and whooping cough[222, 240, 254]. The pericarp is peripherally vasoconstrictive[7]. The seeds are decongestant, expectorant and tonic[7, 21]. They have been used in the treatment of rheumatism, neuralgia and haemorrhoids[4]. They are said to be narcotic and that 10 grains of the nut are equal to 3 grains of opium[213]. An oil extracted from the seeds has been used externally as a treatment for rheumatism[254]. A compound of the powdered roots is analgesic and has been used to treat chest pains[257]. The buds are used in Bach flower remedies - the keywords for prescribing it are: Failure to learn by experience', 'Lack of observation in the lessons of life' and hence 'The need of repetition'[209]. The flowers are used in Bach flower remedies - the keywords for prescribing it are 'Persistent unwanted thoughts' and 'Mental arguments and conversations'[209].

There has been a large amount of research into the effects of this plant, several medically active compounds have been identified with a wide range of effective actions[ 310 ]. The aerial parts of the plant contain a large number of diterpenes, whilst the presence of flavones in the root has also been reported[ 310 ]. Extracts and purified diterpenes and flavonoids have been investigated for a multitude of pharmacological effects. Trials using the leaf extract have concluded that the powdered leaves have the capacity to significantly shorten the duration of common colds and that the leaves can be as effective as paracetamol in relieving the fever and sore throat of people with pharyngotonsilitis [ 310 ] The leaves have also been shown to have significant anti-inflammatory effect and also significantly inhibit oedema[ 310 ] An ethanol extract of the leaves stimulates both antigen-specific and nonspecific immune responses more than the purified leaf extracts. An ethanol extract has also shown significant antipyretic activity. A standardized leaf extract exhibits significant antipyretic properties and is an effective analgesic[ 310 ]. The crude water extract of the leaves, as well as the semi-purified n-butanol and aqueous fractions, have shown significant hypotensive activity[ 310 ]. In one trial, a 10% infusion of the herb applied intravenously at 1 ml/kg bodyweight reduced the blood pressure by 6-10 mm Hg in 10-20 seconds[ 310 ]. An extract of the leaves has also been shown to lower cholesterol levels, whilst antithrombotic effects were also observed. It is believed that these effects might be at least partially due to flavones present in the extract[ 310 ]. Administered intraperitoneally, the diterpenes andrographiside and neoandrographolide (found in the leaves) have a significant protective effect on the liver. An extract of the leaves has shown antidiarrhoeal activity[ 310 ]. The diterpenes andrographolide and neoandrographolide isolated from the alcoholic extract showed potent antisecretory activity against Escherichia coli enterotoxin induced secretions. Various compounds have shown significant anti-ulcer properties. It is suggested that this effect is due to the antisecretory activity and protective effect on the gastric mucosa[ 310 ]. Oral administration of 20 mg of the dry leaf powder for 60 days has an antifertility effect in males[ 310 ]. The alcoholic extract of the rhizomes exhibits good in vitro anthelmintic activity against Ascaris lumbricoides[ 310 ]. Neoandrographolide, isolated from the leaves, exhibits significant antimalarial activity[ 310 ] Dehydroandrographolide succinic acid monoester, derived from andrographolide, has been found to inhibit the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in vitro[ 310 ]. A leaf infusion administered intraperitoneally, has an LD50 at 71.1 mg/10 g body weight (acute toxicity). At a concentration of 1 mg/kg it lowers the body temperature at least 2?C[ 310 ]. The plant used to be considered an effective remedy against snake bites and it is still used locally for this[ 310 ]. It has also been reported as useful to treat insect bites and, in combination with Orthosiphon aristatus, as a remedy for diabetes[ 310 ]. An infusion or sap from the crushed leaves has been recommended for the treatment of fever, as a tonic, and for itching skin eruptions[ 310 ]. A decoction of the leaves or roots is used against stomach-ache, dysentery, typhus, cholera, influenza and bronchitis, as a vermifuge, and is considered a diuretic[ 310 ]. Pills or infusions are also recommended to treat female disorders, dyspepsia, hypertension, rheumatism, gonorrhoea, amenorrhoea, torpid liver and jaundice[ 310 ]. Another use is as a poultice on swollen legs or feet, vitiligo and piles[ 310 ]. Furthermore, Andrographis paniculata is considered to be anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive, but reports on antibacterial activity are contradictory[ 310 ]. The leaves should be harvested when the inflorescence axis starts to grow, because the maximum accumulation of andrographolide is at that stage[ 310 ]. The roots are harvested when leaves start discolouring or wilting[ 310 ]. Yields of 1 - 1.5 kg fresh weight/plant are obtained from 7-month-old plants[ 310 ]. In general, the herb is used fresh and consumed within a few days after collection[ 310 ]. However, leaves and roots should be washed and dried in the sun or artificially before storage[ 310 ].",

Its reputation is perhaps second only to ginseng (Panax ginseng) and it is particularly noted for its 'blood tonic' effects on women[218]. The root has a sweet pungent aroma that is very distinctive and it is often used in cooking, which is the best way to take it as a blood tonic[254]. One report says that the root contains vitamin B12 and can be used in the treatment of pernicious anaemia[176]. The root is alterative, analgesic, anticholesterolemic, anti-inflammatory, antispasmodic, deobstruent, emmenagogue, emollient, hepatic, laxative, sedative and peripheral vasodilator[165, 176, 218]. It is commonly used in the treatment of a wide range of women's complaints where it regulates the menstrual cycle and relieves period pain[218, 238, 254] and also to ensure a healthy pregnancy and easy delivery[218]. However conflicting information suggests it should not be used during pregnancy [301] and should not be used if menstrual flow is heavy or during menstration [301]. It is an ideal tonic for women with heavy menstruation who risk becoming anaemic[254]. The water-soluble and non-volatile elements of the root increase the contraction of the uterus whilst the volatile elements can relax the muscle of the uterus[176]. Its use prevents the decrease of liver glycogen and protects the liver[176]. Used for menopausal symptoms (hot flushes) [301]. It has an antibacterial action, inhibiting the growth of various bacteria including Bacillus dysenteriae, Bacillus typhi, B. comma, B. cholerae and haemolytic streptococci[176]. The root is an ingredient of 'Four Things Soup', the most widely used woman's tonic in China[254]. The other species used are Rehmannia glutinosa, Ligusticum wallichii and Paeonia lactiflora[254]. The root is harvested in the autumn or winter and dried for later use[254, 283]. It has been used to treat pulmonary hypertension in combination with the allopathic medication nifedipine [301]. Other uses include: constipation (a laxative), trauma injuries, ulcers, rheumatism and malaria [301].",

The leaves contain hydroquinones and are strongly antibacterial, especially against certain organisms associated with urinary infections[238]. The plant should be used with caution, however, because hydroquinones are also toxic[222]. The leaves are antiseptic, astringent, diuretic, lithontripic, hypnotic and tonic[7, 9, 21, 102, 165, 172, 192]. The dried leaves are used in the treatment of a variety of complaints[4]. These leaves should be harvested in early autumn, only green leaves being selected, and then dried in gentle heat[4]. A tea made from the dried leaves is much used for kidney and bladder complaints and inflammations of the urinary tract such as acute and chronic cystitis and urethritis, but it should be used with caution and preferably only under the supervision of a qualified practitioner[4, 21, 46, 172, 222, 254]. The tea is more effective if the urine is alkaline, thus it is best used in combination with a vegetable-based diet[254]. Externally, a poultice of the infused leaves with oil has been used as a salve to treat rashes, skin sores etc, and as a wash for a baby's head[257]. An infusion of the leaves has been used as an eyewash, a mouthwash for cankers and sore gums and as a poultice for back pains, rheumatism, burns etc[257]. The dried leaves have been used for smoking as an alternative to tobacco[238]. One report says that it is unclear whether this was for medicinal purposes or for the intoxicated state it could produce[192], whilst another says that the leaves were smoked to treat headaches and also as a narcotic[257]. The herb should not be prescribed to children, pregnant women or patients with kidney disease[238]. Another report says that some native North American Indian tribes used an infusion of the stems, combined with blueberry stems (Vaccinium spp) to prevent miscarriage without causing harm to the baby, and to speed a woman's recovery after the birth[257]. Other uses: fluid retention and bed wetting. Claimed to strengthen the heart muscle and urinary tract and to return the womb to its normal size after childbirth [301]. Treatment should be short (seven days) and used with an alkaline diet [301]. Not recommended for children under 12.",

The leaves can be used fresh or dried, they are best harvested in the morning of a fine sunny day just after the dew has dried from them[4]. The flowers are also used fresh or dried, for drying they are harvested when fully open and need to be dried quickly in the shade[4]. A tea of the petals tones up the circulation and, taken regularly, can ease varicose veins[201]. An application of the crushed stems to corns and warts will soon render them easily removable[7]. The leaves, blossoms and buds are used to make a homeopathic remedy[232]. It is used internally in order to speed the healing of wounds[232].

The root-bark, leaves and flowers also have laxative properties, but to a lesser extent[ 299 ]. In modern medicine, the fruit pulp is sometimes used as a mild laxative in paediatrics[ 299 ]. The fruit pulp and leaves are rich in anthraquinone derivatives (around 2%), and glycosides, which are responsible for the laxative properties[ 299 ]. The fruit pulp is rich in pectins and mucilage[ 299 ]. In-vitro and in-vivo tests have shown that the seed powder has amoebicidal and cysticidal properties against Entamoeba histolytica and that it could cure intestinal amoebiasis of humans. The aqueous fraction of the pods has produced a significant decrease in glycaemia[ 299 ]. Aqueous and methanolic bark extracts have shown significant anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activities[ 299 ]. An alcohol extract of the leaves has shown antibacterial activity in vivo against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, plus accelerated wound healing[ 299 ]. A water extract of the leaves has shown antifungal activity against the human skin pathogens Trichophyton spp., Epidermatophyton floccosum and Microsporum ferruginum[ 299 ]. The pods are used as a remedy for malaria, blood poisoning, anthrax, diabetes and dysentery[ 299 ]. The pods contain a sweet, sticky pulp[ 307 ]. A decoction of this is taken as a cure for kidney stones, as a vermifuge and as a laxative[ 299 ]. The pulp is extracted from the pods by bruising them and then boiling them in water, after which the decoction is evaporated. It may be obtained from fresh pods by opening them at the sutures and removing the pulp with a spatula[ 459 ]. The pulp is apt to become sour if long exposed to the air, or mouldy if kept in a damp place[459. The bark or leaves are widely applied to skin problems[299. Broken bones and tropical ulcers are bandaged with bark scrapings and leaf sap[ 299 ]. The heartwood is traditionally applied as an anthelmintic[ 299 ]. A decoction of the roots is applied to purify wounds and ulcers[ 299 ]. In India the roots are used to treat fevers[ 299 ]. The concentration of sennoside in the leaves of Cassia fistula is highest soon after the onset of the rainy season, when new leaves have appeared and flowering started[ 299 ].

A hot poultice of the young shoots is used as a dressing for ulcers, abscesses, wounds, cuts and bush sores[ 348 ]. The dried leaves are smoked to alleviate asthma[ 307 ]. The juice of the plant is used as a caustic to remove warts[ 46 ]. The sap is used to treat fresh cuts[ 348 ]. A decoction of the inner bark is used in the treatment of dysentery[ 348 ].",

In France it is still used as a remedy for tired eyes, but opinions differ as to its efficacy[254, 268]. Traditionally it is said to work best on blue eyes, whilst Plantago major (great plantain) was used for brown eyes[268]. The dried flowers are antipruritic, antitussive, astringent, weakly diuretic, emmenagogue, ophthalmic, very mildly purgative, and tonic[4, 7, 9, 21, 201, 240]. An infusion can be used in the treatment of dropsy, constipation, or as a mouthwash for ulcers and bleeding gums[9, 238]. This infusion is also taken as a bitter tonic and stimulant, improving the digestion and possibly supporting the liver as well as improving resistance to infections[254]. A water distilled from the petals was formerly in repute as a remedy for weak eyes[4] and a soothing lotion for conjunctivitis[7, 240]. The seeds are used as a mild laxative for children[7, 254]. A decoction of the leaves is antirheumatic[7, 254]. Antifungal [303].",

Its Indian name is 'Brahmi' which means 'bringing knowledge of the Supreme Reality' and it has long been used there medicinally and as an aid to meditation[238]. It is a useful tonic and cleansing herb for skin problems and digestive disorders[254]. In India it is chiefly valued as a revitalizing herb that strengthens nervous function and memory[254]. The whole plant is alterative, cardio-depressant, hypotensive, weakly sedative and tonic[240]. It is a rejuvenating diuretic herb that clears toxins, reduces inflammations and fevers, improves healing and immunity, improves the memory and has a balancing effect on the nervous system[147, 152, 238, 240]. It has been suggested that regular use of the herb can rejuvenate the nervous system and it therefore deserves attention as a possible cure for a wide range of nervous disorders including multiple sclerosis[K]. Recent research has shown that gotu kola reduces scarring, improves circulatory problems in the lower limbs and speeds the healing process[238]. It is used internally in the treatment of wounds, chronic skin conditions (including leprosy), venereal diseases, malaria, varicose veins, ulcers, nervous disorders and senility[238, 240]. Caution should be observed since excess doses cause headaches and transient unconsciousness[238]. Externally, the herb is applied to wounds, haemorrhoids and rheumatic joints[238]. The plant can be harvested at any time of the year and is used fresh or dried[238]. Another report says that the dried herb quickly loses its medicinal properties and so is best used fresh[237].",

The plant is used internally in the treatment of heart complaints, and is especially used in conjunction with Convallaria majalis[238]. The plant is also strongly diuretic, stimulating urine production and thus countering fluid retention[254]. Since broom causes the muscles of the uterus to contract, it has been used to prevent blood loss after childbirth[254]. Use this herb with caution since large doses are likely to upset the stomach[4, 21]. The composition of active ingredients in the plant is very changeable, this makes it rather unreliable medicinally and it is therefore rarely used[9]. This herb should not be prescribed to pregnant women or patients with high blood pressure[238]. Any treatment with this plant should only be carried out under expert supervision[9]. See also the notes above on toxicity. The young herbaceous tips of flowering shoots are harvested in spring, generally in May[4]. They can be used fresh or dried[4, 238]. They should not be stored for more than 12 months since the medicinally active ingredients break down[238].",

The leaf juice is used to treat snakebites and scorpion stings[218]. The roots of most, if not all, members of this genus, contains diosgenin[222, 240].

It is especially useful in states of exhaustion from chronic disease and in all cases of debility, weakness of the digestive system and lack of appetite[4]. It is one of the best strengtheners of the human system, stimulating the liver, gall bladder and digestive system[238], and is an excellent tonic to combine with a purgative in order to prevent its debilitating effects[4]. The root is anthelmintic, anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, bitter tonic, cholagogue, emmenagogue, febrifuge, refrigerant and stomachic[4, 7, 9, 14, 21, 165]. It is taken internally in the treatment of liver complaints, indigestion, gastric infections and anorexia[238]. It should not be prescribed for patients with gastric or duodenal ulcers[238].

The hairs on the fruits contain lupulin, a sedative and hypnotic drug[213, 218]. When given to nursing mothers, lupulin increases the flow of milk - recent research has shown that it contains a related hormone that could account for this effect[7]. The decoction from the flower is said to remedy swellings and hardness of the uterus[269].

        description: "Himatanthus sucuuba is a well respected and widely used medicinal plant in herbal medicine systems in the Amazon and South America; many of its traditional uses have been explained and verified by research. It is mainly used for treating pain and inflammation related to many conditions; cancerous tumours, and as a broad spectrum antimicrobial for various internal and external infections[318 ]. Although toxic in larger doses, toxicity studies indicate that the use of the plant at traditional dosages is non-toxic. There have been no toxic, abortive, or birth defects reported[318 ]. The plant contains several medically active compounds. An antitumor iridoid compound and two depsides showing inhibitory activity of monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) have been isolated from the bark[318 ]. In addition, two iridoid chemicals called plumericin and isoplumericin have been found in the bark and the latex. These two chemicals have been reported with cytotoxic, anticancer, antifungal and antibacterial actions in laboratory research[318 ]. An extract of the bark has been shown to provide significant protection from ulcers and to reduce gastric hypersecretion through several novel mechanisms of actions[318 ]. The latex has shown significant anti-inflammatory and pain relieving actions. The latex can exert anti-inflammatory effects even in the acute phase of the inflammatory process. This action has been attributed to the cinnamate chemicals that are found in the latex and bark. The bark has been shown to be significantly cytotoxic to five different human cancer cell lines, which may help explain why the tree has been used against cancer and tumours for many years in South America. This anti-cancerous action is probably related to the iridoids and triterpenoids in the tree bark[318 ]. Research has shown that the bark has a greater antifungal effect than a control drug (nistatin) that was used - this action has been attributed to the triterpenic esters found in the bark[318 ]. The plants effectiveness in treating infected wounds, candida, tuberculosis, syphilis, and even mange might be explained by the documented antimicrobial actions of the bark and latex[318 ]. The plant's use in the treatment of asthma might be explained by the smooth-muscle relaxant actions documented in 2005 by Brazilian researchers working with a bark extract[318 ]. The bark and the latex are considered analgesic, antiinflammatory, antirheumatic, antitumor, antifungal, anthelmintic, aphrodisiac, astringent, blood purifier, emmenagogue, emollient, febrifuge, laxative, purgative, tonic, vermifuge and vulnerary[318 , 739 ]. A decoction of the bark is taken internally in the treatment of rheumatism, stomach aches and body aches and pain. Applied externally, the powdered tree bark is sprinkled directly onto stubborn wounds and sores. The latex is placed in warm water which is used to bathe the part of the body suffering from arthritis, pain and/or inflammation[318 ]. The latex is also put directly onto abscesses, sores, wounds, rashes and skin ulcers. It is rubbed on to bot-fly bites in order to suffocate and kill the larvae under the skin (in both animals and humans)[318 , 739 ]. Both bark and latex are also used in the treatment of lymphatic gland diseases and inflammation; female disorders such as endometriosis, uterine fibroid tumours, menstrual irregularities and pain, ovarian cysts and ovarian inflammation; cancerous tumours and skin cancers; digestion problems such as indigestion, stomach aches, bowel inflammation and gastric ulcers; coughs, fevers, headaches, asthma and other lung disorders[318 , 739 ].",

Recent research has shown that compounds called 'daidzin' and 'daidzein', which are contained in the roots and the flowers, are a safe and effective method for treating alcohol abuse[238]. They work by suppressing the appetite for alcohol, whereas existing treatments interfere with the way the alcohol is metabolised and can cause a build-up of toxins[238]. The plant is often used in combination with Chrysanthemum x morifolium in treating alcohol abuse[254]. The flowers and the roots are antidote, antiemetic, antipyretic, antispasmodic, demulcent, diaphoretic, digestive, febrifuge, hypoglycaemic and hypotensive[174, 176, 218, 222, 238]. A concoction of the flowers and tubers is used to treat alcoholism, fever, colds, diarrhoea, dysentery, acute intestinal obstruction etc[174, 176, 218, 222]. It is useful in the treatment of angina pectoris and migraine[218]. The root is frequently used as a remedy for measles, often in combination with Cimicifuga foetida[254]. The root contains puerarin. This increases the blood flow to the coronary artery and protects against acute myocardial ischaemia caused by the injection of pituitrin[176]. The root can be harvested from the autumn to the spring and is used fresh or dried[238]. The flowers are harvested just before they are fully open and are dried for later use[238]. The stems are galactogogue and are also applied as a poultice to incipient boils, swellings, sore mouths etc[218, 222]. The seed is used in the treatment of hangover and dysentery[218, 222].

The root is taken internally in the treatment of chronic constipation, diarrhoea, liver and gall bladder complaints, haemorrhoids, menstrual problems and skin eruptions due to an accumulation of toxins[238]. This remedy is not prescribed for pregnant or lactating women, nor for patients with intestinal obstruction[238]. Externally, the root is used in the treatment of burns[238]. The roots are harvested in October from plants that are at least six years old, they are then dried for later use[4]. A homeopathic remedy is prepared from the dried root[232]. This is used especially in the treatment of diarrhoea in teething children[232].",

A poultice of the chewed leaves has been used to allay the pain of bee stings[257]. The leaves have been placed in the shoes as a protection from athletes foot[257]. The roots are blood tonic and diuretic[257]. A decoction of the roots has been used by adults and children in the treatment of diarrhoea and intestinal influenza[257]. A decoction of the root or inner bark has been used in the treatment of colds[257]. An infusion of the fruits has been used in the treatment of coughs[257]. Various parts of the plant have been used to make poultices to apply to burns, sores, cuts, swellings and wounds[257]. A decoction of the branches, combined with chokecherry (Prunus virginiana) and red willow (Salix bonplandiana), has been used in the treatment of various women's complaints, diarrhoea and vomiting[257]. The fruit of many members of this genus is a very rich source of vitamins and minerals, especially in vitamins A, C and E, flavanoids and other bio-active compounds. It is also a fairly good source of essential fatty acids, which is fairly unusual for a fruit. It is being investigated as a food that is capable of reducing the incidence of cancer and also as a means of halting or reversing the growth of cancers[214].",

Research has shown that the plant is rich in volatile oils, flavanoids and phenolic acids, which are strongly antiseptic and anti-inflammatory[238]. Rosmarinic acid has potential in the treatment of toxic shock syndrome, whilst the flavonoid diosmin is reputedly more effective than rutin in reducing capillary fragility[238]. Rosmarol, an extract from the leaves, has shown remarkably high antioxidant activity[218]. The whole plant is antiseptic, antispasmodic, aromatic, astringent, cardiac, carminative, cholagogue, diaphoretic, emmenagogue, nervine, stimulant, stomachic and tonic[4, 21, 89, 165, 218]. An infusion of the flowering stems made in a closed container to prevent the steam from escaping is effective in treating headaches, colic, colds and nervous diseases[4]. A distilled water from the flowers is used as an eyewash[7]. The leaves can be harvested in the spring or summer and used fresh, they can also be dried for later use[7]. This remedy should not be prescribed for pregnant women since in excess it can cause an abortion[238]. An essential oil distilled from the stems and leaves is often used medicinally, that distilled from the flowering tops is superior but not often available[4]. The oil is applied externally as a rubefacient, added to liniments, rubbed into the temples to treat headaches and used internally as a stomachic and nervine[4]. The essential oil is used in aromatherapy. Its keyword is 'Stimulant'[210]. The German Commission E Monographs, a therapeutic guide to herbal medicine, approve Rosmarinus officinalis Rosemary for rheumatism, dyspeptic complaints, loss of appetite, blood pressure problems (see [302] for critics of commission E).",

It is used internally in the treatment of constipation, diarrhoea, piles, bleeding of the lungs, various blood complaints and also chronic skin diseases[4, 238, 257]. Externally, the root can be mashed and used as a poultice and salve, or dried and used as a dusting powder, on sores, ulcers, wounds and various other skin problems[257]. The root has been used with positive effect to restrain the inroads made by cancer, being used as an alterative and tonic[4]. The root is harvested in early spring and dried for later use[4]. Some caution is advised in its use since excess doses can cause gastric disturbance, nausea and dermatitis[222, 238]. The seed is used in the treatment of diarrhoea[4, 218]. A homeopathic remedy is made from the fresh root, harvested in the autumn before frost has touched the plant[232]. It is only used in the treatment of a specific type of cough[232].",

A water-soluble and heat-stable toxic compound, hypoglycin A, is present in the aril of unripe seeds, as well as in the seed and in the pinkish to reddish tissue at the base of the aril. The Jamaican vomiting sickness is associated with this compound and is characterized by vomiting, generalized weakness, altered consciousness and sometimes even death. Hypoglycaemia and depression of the central nervous system are common. The aril of fully ripe seeds after natural dehiscence of the fruit is nearly free of the toxic compound. The consumption of unripe seed arils has probably caused many cases of encephalopathy in children in Burkina Faso and other West African countries.",

The seed and leaves are anticholesterolemic, anti-inflammatory, antitumor, carminative, demulcent, deobstruent, emollient, expectorant, febrifuge, galactogogue, hypoglycaemic, laxative, parasiticide, restorative and uterine tonic[4, 7, 21, 147, 165, 176, 238]. The seed yields a strong mucilage and is therefore useful in the treatment of inflammation and ulcers of the stomach and intestines[4, 254]. Taken internally, a decoction of the ground seeds serves to drain off the sweat ducts[7]. The seed is very nourishing and body-building and is one of the most efficacious tonics in cases of physical debility caused by anaemia or by infectious diseases, especially where a nervous factor is involved[7, 244]. It is also used in the treatment of late-onset diabetes, poor digestion (especially in convalescence), insufficient lactation, painful menstruation, labour pains etc[238, 244]. The seeds freshen bad breath and restore a dulled sense of taste[254]. Externally, the seeds can be ground into a powder and used as a poultice for abscesses, boils, ulcers, burns etc, or they can be used as a douche for excessive vaginal discharge[4, 244, 254]. The leaves are harvested in the growing season and can be used fresh or dried[238]. The seeds are harvested when fully ripe and dried for later use[238]. Compounds extracted from the plant have shown cardiotonic, hypoglycaemic, diuretic, antiphlogistic and hypotensive activity[218]. One of its constituent alkaloids, called 'trigonelline', has shown potential for use in cancer therapy. The seed contains the saponin diosgenin, an important substance in the synthesis of oral contraceptives and sex hormones[244], whilst saponins in the plant have been extracted for use in various other pharmaceutical products[238]. The German Commission E Monographs, a therapeutic guide to herbal medicine, approve Trigonella foenum-graecum for loss of appetite, inflammation of the skin (see [302] for critics of commission E).",

        description: "Gurmar is an important, bitter-tasting Ayurvedic herb that is used especially to reduce blood sugar levels in diabetics[304 ]. Both roots and leaves can be used[304 ]. The plant contains a group of oleanane type triterpenoid saponins known as gymnemic acids, a complex mixture of at least 9 closely related acidic glycosides, which have taste-modifying activity; and gurmarin, which is a sweet taste-suppressing polypeptide. When the leaf is chewed, the ability to taste sweetness is lost temporarily[299 ]. Studies have demonstrated that the leaf powder may exert an antidiabetic effect via a number of pathways, including decreasing the uptake of glucose from the small intestine; improvements in glycogen synthesis, glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and hepatic and muscle glucose uptake; as well as the reversal of haemoglobin and plasma protein glycosylation[299 ]. The plant is antidote, astringent, diuretic, emetic, hypoglycaemic, purgative, refrigerant, stomachic and tonic[304 ]. It is used particularly to reduce sugar levels in the blood and urine[304 ]. The leaves are used in the treatment of fevers and coughs[299 ]. The powdered leaf is considered to help curb cravings for sweets and to have lipid lowering effects, it is added to food additives as a weight loss remedy[299 ]. The powder also helps in preventing caries[299 ]. Applied externally the leaves are combined with castor oil and used as a poultice to treat swollen glands[304 ]. The roots are considered to be a useful antidote to snakebite - they are applied to the wound as a powder, made into a paste with water or given internally as a decoction[299 , 304 ]. The pounded and cooked roots are added to food and eaten as a treatment for epilepsy[299 ]. The pounded cooked root or root powder is applied externally to treat boils[299 ].",

The root is also experimentally cholagogue, hypoglycaemic and a weak antibiotic against yeast infections[222]. The dried root has a weaker action[222]. The roots can be used fresh or dried and should be harvested in the autumn when 2 years old[4]. The leaves are harvested in the spring when the plant is in flower and can be dried for later use[9]. A tea can be made from the leaves or, more commonly, from the roots[213]. The plant is used internally in the treatment of gall bladder and urinary disorders, gallstones, jaundice, cirrhosis, dyspepsia with constipation, oedema associated with high blood pressure and heart weakness, chronic joint and skin complaints, gout, eczema and acne[238]. The plant has an antibacterial action, inhibiting the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Pneumococci, Meningococci, Bacillus dysenteriae, B. typhi, C. diphtheriae, Proteus etc[176]. The latex contained in the plant sap can be used to remove corns, warts and verrucae[7]. The latex has a specific action on inflammations of the gall bladder and is also believed to remove stones in the liver[7]. A tea made from the leaves is laxative[222].

The inner bark is bitter and astringent, it is used in treating intermittent fevers[4]. The vernal sap is diuretic[4]. The buds are balsamic[7]. The young shoots and leaves secrete a resinous substance which has acid properties, when combined with alkalis it is a tonic laxative[4]. The leaves are anticholesterolemic and diuretic[7]. They also contain phytosides, which are effective germicides[7]. An infusion of the leaves is used in the treatment of gout, dropsy and rheumatism, and is recommended as a reliable solvent of kidney stones[4]. The young leaves and leaf buds are harvested in the spring and dried for later use[238]. A decoction of the leaves and bark is used for bathing skin eruptions[4]. Moxa is made from the yellow fungous excrescences of the wood, which sometimes swell out of the fissures[4].

Western herbalists consider it a 'food for the heart', it increases the blood flow to the heart muscles and restores normal heart beat[254]. This effect is brought about by the presence of bioflavonoids in the fruit, these bioflavonoids are also strongly antioxidant, helping to prevent or reduce degeneration of the blood vessels[254]. The fruit is antispasmodic, cardiac, diuretic, sedative, tonic and vasodilator[4, 9, 21, 46, 165]. Both the fruits and flowers of hawthorns are well-known in herbal folk medicine as a heart tonic and modern research has borne out this use. The fruits and flowers have a hypotensive effect as well as acting as a direct and mild heart tonic[222]. They are especially indicated in the treatment of weak heart combined with high blood pressure[222], they are also used to treat a heart muscle weakened by age, for inflammation of the heart muscle, arteriosclerosis and for nervous heart problems[21]. Prolonged use is necessary for the treatment to be efficacious[222]. It is normally used either as a tea or a tincture[222]. Hawthorn is combined with ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba) to enhance poor memory, working by improving the blood supply to the brain[254]. The bark is astringent and has been used in the treatment of malaria and other fevers[7]. The roots are said to stimulate the arteries of the heart[218].",

There are different opinions as to the best time to harvest the leaves, but they should only be used fresh because the active principles are destroyed if the leaves are dried[4]. Although no specific mention has been seen for this species, all members of the genus contain amygdalin and prunasin, substances which break down in water to form hydrocyanic acid (cyanide or prussic acid).

An infusion of the leaves or whole plant is used to treat menstrual irregularities and as an anthelmintic, especially for children[4, 213]. It is also valuable in treating hysteria, kidney weaknesses, stomach problems, fevers and also as an emmenagogue[4]. In larger doses the plant can procure an abortion, though these doses can be poisonous[213]. Externally, tansy is used as a poultice on swellings and some eruptive skin diseases[4].

The fruit is an excellent gentle and safe laxative[257]. Berberine, universally present in rhizomes of Mahonia species, has marked antibacterial effects[218] and is used as a bitter tonic[213]. Since it is not appreciably absorbed by the body, it is used orally in the treatment of various enteric infections, especially bacterial dysentery[218].

Regarded as a general cure-all, it was and is used as a tonic and rejuvenating herb to treat a wide range of illnesses and restore virility to the body[318 ]. In modern herbal medicine the root is considered to be an adaptogen and a tonic, able to increase the body's resistance to adverse influences by a wide range of physical, chemical, and biochemical factors and having a normalizing or restorative effect on the body as a whole[318 ]. It is taken to stimulate appetite and circulation; increase oestrogen production; balance blood sugar levels; enhance the immune system; strengthen the muscular system; enhance memory; and as a general restorative tonic after illness[318 ]. It is used to treat exhaustion and chronic fatigue; impotence; arthritis; anaemia; diabetes; cancer; high blood pressure; PMS, menopause, and hormonal disorders; and many types of stress[318 ]. The root contains 19 different amino acids, a large number of electrolytes, trace minerals, iron, magnesium, zinc, vitamins A, B1, B2, E, K , and pantothenic acid. Its high germanium content probably accounts for its properties as an oxygenator at the cellular level; its high iron content may account for its traditional use for anaemia. The root also contains novel phytochemicals including saponins, pfaffic acids, glycosides, and nortriterpenes[318 ]. Saponins are well known to have a wide spectrum of activities including lowering blood cholesterol; inhibiting cancer cell growth; and acting as antifungal and antibacterial agents[318 ]. They are also known as natural detergent and foaming agents[318 ]. Phytochemists report that saponins can act by binding with bile acids and cholesterol. It is thought that these chemicals 'clean' or purge these fatty compounds from the body (thus lowering blood cholesterol levels)[318 ]. The specific saponins found in the roots of suma include a group of novel phytochemicals named pfaffosides. These saponins have clinically demonstrated the ability to inhibit tumour cell melanomas and help to regulate blood sugar levels[318 ]. Pfaffia has demonstrated analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities in various studies[318 ].",

The flavour is somewhat unpleasant, however, and it can cause nausea in some people[4]. The oil has a remarkable antidandruff effect[7]. The oil is well-tolerated by the skin and so is sometimes used as a vehicle for medicinal and cosmetic preparations[254]. Castor oil congeals to a gel-mass when the alcoholic solution is distilled in the presence of sodium salts of higher fatty acids[240].

For example, the latex has antibiotic properties against Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogens[303 ]. It also has coagulating effects on blood plasma[303 ]. A methanol extract of the leaves afforded moderate protection for cultured human lymphoblastoid cells against the cytopathic effects of the human immunodeficiency virus[303 ]. The juice of the bark is used in the treatment of malarial fevers, and is also useful in reducing swellings caused by inflammation[272 ]. This juice is also applied externally to treat burns, scabies, eczema and ringworm[272 ]. The fresh bark is cut into small pieces and chewed or kept in the mouth for 1 - 2 hours in order to treat pyorrhoea[272 ]. A paste of the bark is applied to the gums to treat wounds and swellings of the gums[272 ]. The thin twigs are popularly used in Nepal as toothbrushes to treat toothache[272 ]. They are considered especially good for treating bleeding and swollen gums[272 ]. A leaf infusion is used as a diuretic, for bathing, to treat coughs, and as an enema in treating convulsions and fits[303 ]. The leaves are also used to treat jaundice, fevers, rheumatic pains, guinea worm sores and poor development of the foetus in pregnant women[303 ]. In Ghana the ashes from the burnt leaves are applied by rectal injection for treating haemorrhoids[303 ]. The juice of the leaves, or the latex, is applied directly to wounds and cuts as a styptic and astringent to clean teeth, gums, and to treat sores on the tongue and in the mouth[303 ]. It is also considered useful for treating decayed teeth[272 , 348 ]. The seeds resemble groundnuts in flavour, and 15 - 20 seeds will cause griping, purging and vomiting for 30 minutes. It is reported from Gabon that 1 - 2 roasted seeds are sufficient to act as a purgative; larger doses may be dangerous. The seeds have been substituted for castor oil and are sometimes called 'larger castor oil'. The seeds are also used in the treatment of syphilis[303 ]. The oil from the seeds, known as 'curcas'’ is a powerful purgative and emetic[46 , 272 ]. The oil is widely used for treating skin diseases such as herpes, itches, eczema and boils; and also to soothe pain such as that caused by rheumatism; it is an ingredient in the oily extract, known in Hausa as 'kufi', which is a rubefacient for rheumatism and for parasitic skin conditions. The oil is used to stimulate hair growth. It is used in the treatment of [272 ]. It is warmed and used to dress burns[272 ]. The cotyledons are used to treat constipation and as an appetizer[272 ]. The root bark is used to relieve the spasms of infantile tetanus and is used for sores, dysentery and jaundice[303 ]. The juice of the roots is applied to boils and pimples[272 ].

        description: "Asthma weed has traditionally been used in Asia to treat bronchitic asthma and laryngeal spasm, though in modern herbalism it is more used in the treatment of intestinal amoebic dysentery[268]. It should not be used without expert guidance, however, since large doses cause gastro-intestinal irritation, nausea and vomiting[268]. The plant is anodyne, antipruritic, carminative, depurative, diuretic, febrifuge, galactogogue, purgative and vermifuge[218].The aerial parts of the plant are harvested when in flower during the summer and can be dried for later use[238]. The stem, taken internally, is famed as a treatment for asthma, bronchitis and various other lung complaints[218, 238, 240]. The herb relaxes the bronchioles but apparently depresses the heart and general respiration[218]. It is usually used in combination with other anti-asthma herbs such as Grindelia camporum and Lobelia inflata[254]. It is also used to treat intestinal amoebic dysentery[254]. The whole plant is decocted and used in the treatment of athlete's foot, dysentery, enteritis and skin conditions[218]. It has been used in the treatment of syphilis[4]. The sap is applied to warts in order to destroy them[238, 240]. The treatment needs to be repeated 2 - 3 times a day over a period of several weeks to be fully effective[K].",

It was widely used by the native peoples prior to the Europeans reaching S. America and these uses were soon taken up by the Europeans[ 317 ]. The resin is especially valued for its ability to counter mucous in the chest and genito-urinary system[ 254 ]. The resin is an aromatic, stimulant herb with a bitter, burning taste[ 238 ]. Both it and the bark are anodyne, antacid, antibacterial, antifungal, antiinflammatory, antimicrobial, astringent, cytostatic, demulcent, digestive, disinfectant, diuretic, expectorant, mildly laxative, vermifuge and vulnerary[ 318 ]. The resin obtained from the trunk contains a number of medically active constituents including 30 - 90% essential oils and unusual condensed tannins[ 238 ]. The essential oil contains alpha- and beta-caryophyllene, sesquiterpenes, resins and terpenic acids[ 254 ]. It improves the digestion, has diuretic and expectorant effects, and controls bacterial infections[ 238 ]. Much of the clinical research performed to date has verified the traditional uses of copaiba. It has, for instance, been shown to be highly effective as a topical wound healer and anti-inflammatory agent[ 318 ]. The anti-inflammatory effect is mainly due to the sesquiterpenes, particularly caryophyllene which has also demonstrated effective pain-relieving properties, antifungal properties against nail fungus and gastroprotective properties[ 318 ]. The resin as a whole (and, particularly, two of its diterpenes - copalic acid and kaurenic acid) has demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria. One of copaiba?s other chemicals, kaurenoic acid, has also demonstrated selective antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria in other recent studies[318. Other constituents of the resin have demonstrated significant antitumor activity[ 318 ]. The resin is taken internally in the treatment of a range of respiratory problems such as tuberculosis, bronchitis and sinusitis; urinary tract and reproductive system conditions such as cystitis, kidney and bladder infections, vaginal discharge and gonorrhoea[ 238 , 254 ]. Stomach ulcers, tetanus, herpes, pleurisy and haemorrhages are just some of the other conditions treated with the resin[ 318 ]. Externally, it is used in the treatment of a range of skin problems including insect bites, eczema, chilblains, sores and psoriasis[ 238 , 254. It is also used to treat wounds and stop bleeding[ 318 ]. As an antiseptic gargle, it is used to treat sore throats and tonsillitis[ 318 ]. The resin should be used with care, see notes above on toxicity[ 238 ]. The resin is tapped at intervals from the tree and the holes filled in afterwards[ 238 ]. It is used in infusions or distilled for its essential oil[ 238 ].",
