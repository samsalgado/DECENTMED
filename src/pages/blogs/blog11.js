          One of the best parts of Bitcoin is its supply. Inflation is running rampant and will not cease until it’s too late. USD operates upon the printer, and the Federal Reserve has not stopped printing money. In 2008 the Federal Reserve injected $500 billion into the US economy. How is Bitcoin different from the traditional financial system? Bitcoin has a set supply of 21 million coins, and will never exceed the supply.
           The last Bitcoin mined will be in 2140.
        </p>

        Why does the supply of Bitcoin matter? Checks and balances are vital for everyone, especially for our leaders. If one has a magical money printer, what would incentivize them to stop the printing? Economies of scale, business growth, fighting economic collapse, funding wars and maintaining government control are all incentives to continue printing money. The Federal Reserve (Fed) is not a country, with mass money printers — the Fed has control of the global economy. Bitcoin takes control from the Federal Reserve, people retain economic power. Wars cease because there is no dollar to fund them, and monopolies break because Bitcoin gives outside entities opportunities to enter new sectors. Grain production stems from Asia, yet Asian countries tend to be the poorest countries in the world. Indonesia is a top 5 rice producer in the world, due to IMF bailouts, the Indonesian Rupiah devalued its currency (1997–98) by more than 80%. Americans talk about inflation and do not realize that every currency worldwide has been heavily devalued since the fall of the Golden Standard (1972). The dollar is the number one currency and its value is fading daily.

            The production of Bitcoin is due to a process called Proof of Work. Essentially, the mining device has to solve a complex algorithm to create the Bitcoin. Once Bitcoin is mined, the miner receives a reward. Halving is when the reward cuts in half for mining the Bitcoin. The halving reduces the inflation of Bitcoin and diminishes the amount of mined Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s whitepaper outlines two major ways to reduce inflation and increase demand of Bitcoin: setting supply at 21 million and cutting incentives (halving) in half for miners. The last Bitcoin Halving was in 2024, the current mined amount is about 19 million. The Bitcoin Halving reduces the reward, and vastly slows down the amount of mined of Bitcoin. Henceforth, the demand of Bitcoin skyrockets and the next 2 million mined Bitcoin will take more than a hundred years.

            The elements of 
            Bitcoin: decentralized, 
            no single point of failure, 
            borderless, censorship resistant, no 3rd party, neutral, immutable; illustrate that it is the antithesis of the dollar. 
            Moreover, Bitcoin does not change, cannot be printed and is not tied to a central entity or nation. 
            There is no Federal Reserve controlling Bitcoin (Satoshi Nakamoto identity unverified). 
            Proof of Work algorithms make Bitcoin incorruptible and provide sustained legacy for a new financial system. 
            The Federal Reserve established in 1913, the Gold Standard <a href="https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/R41887.html">“halted in 1933” </a> and ended in
             1971. The Federal Reserve has bankrupted every nation in the world, every nation has 
             faced currency devaluation and the United States “has the worst inflation in the history of America”.
              The US Dollar is reliant on politicians that talk about change, but there is never any change. 
              El Salvador adopted Bitcoin as legal tender in 2022. The United States is falling,
               and <a href="https://investinelsalvador.gob.sv/fmi-confirma-un-crecimiento-economico-del-3-para-el-salvador-en-2024/#:~:text=The%20country's%20economy%20would%20be,set%20at%202.0%20%25%20for%202024.">IMF confirms 3% economic growth in 2024”.</a>
           </p>

           Some economic pundits believe that America should revert to the Gold Standard. Bitcoin operates based on technology, with gold in every cell phone in the world. The Bitcoin Standard is literally and figuratively built upon the Golden Standard. People need a world currency that gives them freedom, not a currency backed by government, a system that provides equality for all. The Gold Standard lasted for millenniums before government intervention. The Bitcoin Standard will last for longer than a hundred years, because the last mined coin is in 2140 — gives the world 116 years to adopt to Bitcoin.
