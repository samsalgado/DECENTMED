        Back pain effects an estimated "80% of the US population". As people age, pain becomes more and more frequent. According to <a href="https://nida.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/2024/05/over-115-million-pills-containing-illicit-fentanyl-seized-by-law-enforcement-in-2023">NIDA</a>: "Over 115 million pills containing illicit fentanyl seized by law enforcement in 2023", if this the seized number, imagine the actual number of pills containing fentanyl last year. The "War on Drugs" was a collosal failure in the United States; Oregon decriminalized drugs in its state. However, this decision hasn't worked either, resulting in rampant drug use, overdose, homelessness and fentanyl deaths. Pain pills, or opioids have a long history of abuse and addiction. "In 2022, over 107,000 people died of a drug overdose, with 75% of those deaths involving an opioid." According to WebMD: "Estimated 3 million Americans suffer from OUD (Opioid Use Disorder)". Chiropractors take a holistic perspective, the body can heal itself. Chiropractic techniques are 40% more effective than medical care for lower back pain. Suffering from back pain? Type: "best chiropractor near me" instead of using pain pills for back.

        Pain can be reocurring, compounding to the point of surgery. An estimated 36% of people do not know if they need surgery. However, most people are unaware of alternatives for pain management. Chiropractors cost less than surgery and pain pills, and have more benefits than pain. Americans are constantly stressed, anxiety is on the rise in America. Corrective care improves the body's ability to handle and adapt to stress. Heart disease is the biggest killer in the world. Corrective care can significantly decrease blood pressure by removing neurological interference and restoring proper spinal biomechanics. <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/04-04-2023-1-in-6-people-globally-affected-by-infertility">"1 in 6 people globally affected by infertility: WHO",</a> chiropractic care helps to restore function to reproductive systems for both men and women. Additionally, chiropractors cost less than traditional medicine.

        The healthcare system is emergency-care, but has many side effects. Studies show that Americans are <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/add.16616">dependent on opiods for non-cancer pain.</a> Last month, <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/safe-supply-lawsuit-bc-1.7295735">"2 families sue province, federal government over safe supply"</a> in British Columbia, Canada over hydromorphone overdose death. Conversely, chiropractic care is not addicting and does not have the vast amount of side effects that stem from opiod usage. Chiropractic care is holistic, working with your body to help it to heal itself. Opiods are addicting, and can be unncessary for back pain. Oftentimes, pain pills for back or other pain management require prescription once a month. Comparatively, chiropractors recommend appointments once a month (seek chiropractor for specific appointment schedule), at a price much lower.

        Chiropractic care improves brain health and behavior. It is designed to work with the body so that it heals itself. Chiropractic care is corrective care, pain pills is emergency care - choose the one that works with your body chemistry. Furthermore, avoid opioids that are foreign chemistry added to your body to heal you.
