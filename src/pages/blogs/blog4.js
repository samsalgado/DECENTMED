           The body has an immense regenerative potential to heal itself. "Let thy food be medicine, and thy medicine be food", Hippocrates, this quote illustrates that fighting disease begins with food. Prevention starts with eating foods that boost the immune system. Consumption of antioxidants like Polyphenols or Beta Carotene assists the immune system in fighting disease before they arrive. Renowed healers, Dr. Sebi and Dr. Gerson found that a mixture of a plant-based diet and detoxification aids in fighting cancer.

           It starts with a diet rich in antioxidants and vitamins. Food is medicine, their is more benefit from the plant than the supplement. Second, utilize plants instead of pills 
            to work in conjunction with the body instead of being reliant on pills. An estimated 30 million Americans do not have access to health insurance.
