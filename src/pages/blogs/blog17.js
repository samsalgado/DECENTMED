            Bitcoin is speculative to some and hope for others. The Bitcoin price has skyrocketed since the recent US election, so the question becomes — what’s next for Bitcoin? Bitcoin is not a stock, so playing “candlesticks” is not feasible for most. Similarly to the Bitcoin price, US inflation has risen rapidly since 2020. According to StatMuse: “Bitcoin closed January 31, 2020 at $9,357.21”. Today (12/3/2024), Bitcoin is $96,770.11. According to Investopedia, US inflation was 1.2% in 2020. In the last couple of years, it’s been 8% (2022) and 4.1% (2023). Canada, South America, Central America, Africa, and Asia have all experienced mass inflation since the fall of the Gold Standard. Businesses want to accept Bitcoin but don’t know how; let’s explain how to accept Bitcoin payments as a business.            </p>

           Bitcoin is an international currency used worldwide. However, different countries have distinct regulations on which wallets you can use to accept Bitcoin payments. Bitcoin payments on the Layer 1 blockchain take about 10 minutes to confirm. If I am a merchant, I cannot wait 10 minutes for transactions to confirm. Introducing Lightning Network, enabling companies to accept Bitcoin payments quicker and cheaper for efficient transactions. Let’s go through multiple examples of how merchants can accept Bitcoin payments.      </p>
      <p>
      Don’t let the name confuse you; Americans can still use Swiss Bitcoin Pay to accept Bitcoin payments as a business. First, download the mobile app on either Google Play or Apple Stores. Next, set up your account with the Business Name, email, and remaining credentials necessary for account creation.

      Best of all, you can convert Bitcoin to your local currency or secondary Bitcoin wallet. If you are in the US, I suggest Crypto.com because it pairs with a bank account and works similarly to online banking. For more information on how to create a Crypto.com wallet, check out this video below.

      What’s one thing that separates Bitcoin from other currencies — control over your money? Unfortunately, Crypto.com and Swiss Bitcoin Pay are not self-custody, meaning, your “keys” or seed random word seed phrase are controlled by the app and not in your full control. Conversely, Muun Wallet is self-custody and enables you to create a self-custodial wallet where the user has full control. When creating your wallet, set a 4-digit password to keep your wallet safe. After setting your password, the wallet is created for full security, you should back up your wallet with a random seed phrase.        </p>
        <p>
        Muun Wallet has the easiest wallet setup and lets you set up both a Lightning address and a Bitcoin address. Outside of the US, other wallets that are easy to use are Blink and Wallet of Satoshi. Once you have both a Bitcoin address and a Lightning address, set up a cold wallet to use as a savings account.

        Finally, accepting payments is great. But you need a Bitcoin savings account. For maximum security, purchasing a cold wallet puts more security over your money. A cold wallet is a device not connected to the internet. The most secure cold wallet is Coldcard because it doesn’t need to be connected to a device like Trezor or Ledger. Instead, the device uses an SD card to make it less susceptible to hacking. To conclude, accept Bitcoin via Lightning with wallets like Muun, Swiss Bitcoin Pay, or Blink (outside the US) and utilize a cold wallet like Coldcard, Trezor, or Ledger as a savings account.
