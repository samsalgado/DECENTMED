  Most doctors and nurses have no clue that the Flexner Report outlines the medicine they practice. The Flexner Report is the blueprint for medicine. Throughout the 1900s, small groups of doctors used detoxifications and juice fasting to fight tumors in the body. Doctors like William Koch and Max Gerson are forgotten - two men who used practices from around the world and attacked in the US. Although the food and minerals are depleted and toxic, detoxes assist in restoring the body to its optimal state. Dr. Gerson prescribed coffee enemas to rid the body of the toxins trapped in the body. The green diet plan and coffee enemas prompt the liver to open the bile ducts and rid the body of tumors and toxins. Gerson's diet protocol is not recommended in the US. Furthermore, a 1 to 3 day cleanse detox helps to fight tumors in the body.

Dr. Sebi found that disease does not exist in a non-acidic environment. Due to the foods we consume, non-alkaline foods guide the body toward acidity. Dr. Sebi, using plants, vegetables, and detoxifications - cured over 500 cancer cases. Dr. Sebi, like other herbalists, was heavily maligned for his work with detoxification. Dr. Andrew Ivy's medical practice focused on using herbs and detoxification to rid the body of tumors. "Optimal health requires the body's biological systems must be in homeostasis with all environmental stressors". Detoxification is a "reset button" enabling the body to reset and begin the healing process.
