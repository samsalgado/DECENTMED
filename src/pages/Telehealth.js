         An estimated 35% of Americans have lost trust in the traditional medical system. An estimated 8% of Americans do not have health insurance. That's around 26 to 28 million people. There needs to be an alternative to the traditional medical system. Introducing Dimemed, a holistic medicine information portal that connects patients with providers. At first, we decided to focus solely on the provider. We found three major pain points associated with provider problems. The first one being patient

acquisition. We feature modalities everything from acupuncture, nutrition, chiropractic, transformative coaching, meditation, Ayurveda, hypnotherapy, naturopathy, homeopathy, breath work, and so much more. All of these type of providers struggle with the issue of patient acquisition. In this system, providers must manage the entire business. Everything from taxing and billing to looking for more clients. Our first goal of decent med is to provide digital marketing and active marketing services to all providers on the platform so that

providers can focus on what they truly love. With my seven years of digital marketing experience, I curate unique solutions for different types of providers. For example, on YouTube, I have found that nutritionists have done very well. We currently feature two nutritionists on the platform. One is Lori Graham and her focus is for senior wellness and women that are 50 plus dealing with menopausal issues. Everything from post-menopause to per menopause and she helps to lower blood sugar utilizing functional medicine and

functional nutrition. The other hand is AJA fitness. We have started to feature products on our platform. We found that we want to be an entire ecosystem featuring not only service providers but the products that they offer. One product that they offer is supplementation. We have found that on YouTube creating content based on supplements for nutritionist and wellness providers has done extremely well. Conversely, we found that for coaches, things like transformational empowerment coaches, sports wellness coaches, and

other types of coaches, it's better to utilize niche types of social media. Everything from Tik Tok to Instagram to LinkedIn. We have found that our hypnotherapists have done very well on Instagram. We have three types of coaches on our platform. a spiritual coach, a wellness coach, and a transformational empowerment coach. We found that those coaches do better when creating content on Tik Tok. So, we have created a 21page holistic medicine business plan, helping all types of service providers and their

various types of products grow. When it comes to digital marketing, there's really three key factors. The first one is keywords. So the 21 plus page holistic business plan has a comprehensive list of all types of keywords, their search volume and their keyword difficulty for being on the first page of Google or their respective social media platform. All for keywords for Instagram, Tik Tok, LinkedIn, the website, YouTube, and so much more. Back to products. Some of the other products that we feature is literature.

So as you see here, this book is solve your out of control eating. This is a nutritionist type book. However, we found that when it comes to nutritionists and general health coaches, one problem that they face is with client compliance. So what this book serves to do is to address that issue by helping ladies specifically but men as well by overcoming their emotional and compulsive eating by focusing on what the trauma or other related factors to the eating might be. Second painoint that we found is with

patient misconceptions. Most people don't know what holistic medicine is. Most Americans know Ayurveda for things like seasonal nutrition, new meditation, yoga, and utilizing different supplements and plant medicine in their diet. Everything is comprised of energy. We are actively looking to feature energy workers on our platform. What the Ayurvedist has taught me when it comes to energy and the connection of energy with everything. She mentioned in her interview that when it comes to the cancer patients that she works with, the

foods that they're eating, they don't have much energy. They're from the vending machine or the cafeteria, so they can keep you alive, but there isn't any energy in the food. A custom page. In this custom page, we offer providers a video interview. The reason why we do this is for two major reasons. The first one being that we optimize your website as well as ours for conversion. According to statistics, your website is 80% more likely to convert with patients when you have a video on your homepage above the fold or

scroll. We clip up the first one to three minutes of the interview so that they can utilize that video on their homepage explaining who they are and how they help people. The second thing that comes with your custom page provider case studies people don't know if these treatments are effective. We post provider studies and health and wellness information on our platform in which we hold the keys. The benefit of that is for censorship resistance. We are a teleaalth directory at our core and like I mentioned earlier, our

tellahalth directory operates as a full-scale digital marketing agency. And as you'll see here, this is a sample listing. So we have two types of listings depending on the type of practitioner that you are. This first listing that you see is for Naturopathy and it is a listing by cards. The reason why we have this type of listing for some of the pages is because she does a myriad of both tellaalth work as well as inerson work. Conversely, we feature chiropractors and acupuncturist. So currently for acupuncture, we feature

two acupuncturists. one that is in Milwaukee and the other one that is in Tampa, Florida. For chiropractors, we feature one chiropractor and another lady that works with applied kinesiology, but she is featured on the chiropractic page. She is in St. Louis and the other chiropractor is in Arizona, Scottsdale to be specific. So, our listings are very different. The final pain point that we found is no matter how large the provider is, whether the provider has 10,000 followers on social media and they are

completely booked out for the next two weeks, they are the one of the largest providers in the country or they are a small provider that's just getting started, just created their practice and they're trying to get it off the ground. So, they really need marketing. No matter which bucket you're in, the one thing that they all have in common is the fact that they're information is either not picked up or they have issues with insurance. Not all providers have this problem. We do feature some

providers on the platform that do not have the issue of insurance, but a lot of providers do have this issue. So to address this concern, what we've done is we created a plant apothecary. I've been traveling the world for the last 10 months documenting plants and their medicinal purposes, utilizing pf.org as a source, as well as uh picture this for utilizing my phone to determine which plant it is. all throughout North South America, some parts of Africa and some parts of Europe. So what our plan is to address the issue

with insurance is that once these plants are officially live, we will utilize a percentage of these plants to make treatments more affordable for the providers on our platform. So, just to explain this in a way that it makes sense, let's say an acupuncturist is $100 per session. We offer providers 1 and 5% depending on the tier that they join of all of the sales of our apothecary. So let's say it's $100 per session and at first, you know, we generate, you know, they get 5%. So 5% of $100 is only

$5 off, but that accumulates over time to the point where eventually we would like to have it where providers that are on our platform book on our platform where a percentage of a sale from our apothecary can make the treatment free for a patient. so that the public can finally get the true free health care that they've been wanting. The reality is that in life nothing is completely free. So in order to have this free system, we have a system in which everything is working each party is all connected.

We handle the farmers and we work with farmers all around the world to curate the plants. We sell the plants to the patient. So the patient is buying in. The provider's already bought in because they pay to be on the platform. Then the patient pays for a plant. They receive their plant. A percentage of that deal now goes to the provider and the provider will get their their money regardless. And the patient will get their treatment and their plants regardless. You might be asking yourself. Well,

Samuel, the apothecary is not live, so why would I join? Great question. So what we have done is in the interim depending on the tier that you join we offer 1 to 5% stake in our teleahalth directory. As I mentioned earlier, our tellahalth directory features a myriad of practices and we're only looking to add more. We want this platform to be extremely robust. The services that we offer to providers will be robust as well. For example, the first offering that we have offered to providers is the ability to be a part of a theme. In

June, it was PTSD and men's mental health awareness month. February of this year, a provider flew me out to Panama. And in that time, I was responsible for shooting and editing a documentary utilizing somatic therapy in conjunction with plant medicine for a man that had PTSD. He was a former Israeli soldier. It was a fiveday retreat. The first day he used plant medicine with somatic yoga and rape. The second and third day he utilized combo in conjunction with rape and somatic yoga. The final day

he utilized buffo. Bufo is a type of plant medicine as well as combo that is a peptide. It's actually comprised of thousands of peptides and you'll you'll see in the documentary all the benefits of combo and buffo. Some other themes that we did in the week was our naturopath Kristen Barnes. Kristen Barnes is from Port Townson, Washington, and she is a former veteran. She utilizes plant medicine with energy work in herathic practice. Not only that, but she works a lot with trauma and trauma

victims. So in her interview we touched on her work with veterans plant medicine with veterans as well as her work with naturopathy and helping with complex diseases. Speaking of complex diseases, our hypnotherapist also was a part of this movement and today we are here with and she works with complex diseases like CPTTSD as well as PTSD. A another person that utilizes complex diseases is our applied kinesiologist, Dr. Amy Wixs. Dr. Wixs utilizes applied kinesiology in conjunction with nutrition, acupuncture,

and chiropractic for complex diseases like autism. Active social marketing, video marketing, keyword research, data analytics, access to backlink service and teleaalth directory. Post studies to validate your work to insurance companies. Customized CRM system for enhanced patient acquisition, management, and retention.
