  wasn't yesterday amazing yeah how about that film I'm so excited to see the rest of the do Series so thank you for being here I'm going to Dive Right In because today we have back to back to back sessions and we got to keep to a very tight schedule um if you haven't yet and you're just arriving today welcome we missed you yesterday it was amazing download app and that has the detailed agenda for you when breaks are happening we do have lunch served today L A little chilly be sitting

outside so Jacks all right I'm going to dive into my presentation which is all about how to personalize your ketogenic land and oh let me grab that all right well for those of you who don't know me uh my name is Christina hes I am a licensed dietician nutritionist and um and your host for today um my Approach is functional and integrative which just means that I take a look at how all your systems are interconnected so when someone works with me we take a really deep dive into all the pieces that could potentially

affect your health with which is not just diet it's a lot of other pieces too so I I like to consider myself a bit of a a detective and uh and and to dive deeper into the root cause of what what things are you know what's happening so how do we get best results well my philosophy is that 80% of your success is psychology right it's your mindset it's your your um adherence compliance right so a lot of it is up up here and then 20% is strategy now you know a lot of people say well you know that 80% like

that's everything but what if you have the wrong strategy right and you have an excellent mindset and you're just following the wrong strategy and you're not getting those results so that is what I'm going to talk about today because years ago I I decided to become a vegetarian and then it escalated I became vegan I even went even further than that and became a raw vegan for four months and what happened to me was I fractured a couple bones over uh series of months and so my body just completely fell

apart and I knew nothing about the genetic piece which is what I'm going to talk about today and I didn't realize that well I don't really convert nutrients very well from you know uh the genes that pertain to certain nutrients where you would derive them from plants so if you have the wrong strategy that you're employing but an excellent mindset bad things can happen too now you can have a great strategy and then you don't you know comply and we're going to hear from uh Robert Sykes today

he's going to talk all about that which is super super important about how to stay true to your low carb diet because that's actually you know a lot of people can lose the weight and then they fall off you know they get bored or just there's fatigue and you know and the carb creep happens so a little bit about me I used to suffer from something called pmdd which is um premenstrual dysphoric disorder so like the three days before my period I would just go super dark all of a sudden you know very very gloomy uh

the world was falling apart and I didn't realize I have some pretty serious issues with magnesium conversion insomnia had that since I was a kid they can't couldn't fall asleep I have sleep genes there too and melatonin would have helped me a lot it would have been good to know good to take as a child and IBS I suffer from IBS but I didn't I didn't know it was IBS and I wasn't super connected I had a lot of cereal aot lot of pasta with skim milk like with every meal so that combo is just you know

deadly so there are a lot of different ways to get into ketosis who's completely new to the ketogenic diet here I mean who who got okay all right so um keto is not really a diet ketosis is a metabolic state where you are burning fat preferentially over glucose okay so you're like a hybrid car so you're if you're running on glucose glucose primarily you're just that's that's your primary fuel source and you're not really utilizing fat super effectively and so when we dial down the

carbohydrates we can flip that switch to using fat your own body fat more efficiently so there's just lots of different ways to do the ketogenic low carb diet okay and you know some people feel very passionate about one way of doing it and that's great because it works really well for them um but that may not work the best for you so uh where I come in is kind of looking at these different issues that are pretty divisive for people that argue about them like political issues right like get super heated you know is

coffee healthy or not um is saturated fat terrible Well yeah if some for some people it actually isn't great um and then Dairy right I'm going to get into that so the Human Genome Project was a 14-year project uh sorry 13-year project to sequence all of all of our genes and you know um unfortunately the this the genetic piece is kind of and this is where it's important to talk about genetics and how your entire metabolism works because the genes are not everything not at all it's

just a blueprint okay but to say that they don't matter is definitely missing an important link because your genes code protein and it's very important information uh to make sure that that information is correct so just to give you a sense like how new what I do is vitamin A was really only discovered a 100 years ago okay vitamin A is the first one that was figured out so then it was B1 and then B2 and on so on and so on that's how they outlined the sequence now in genetics there's kind of

like three major buckets okay there's your ancestry there's you know okay there's a gene and that that one single fixed Gene is a huge problem huge disease that geneticists are trying to figure and solve for that's not what I do I I look at Gene Snips actually pertain to your new nutrient usage and your detoxification and how to optimize your diet so that you're epigenetically optimized in your genetic blueprint so neutrogenia Neutrogena it's a little bit interchangeable neutr

gentics is really where you look at the spelling changes you're like what are my variants and then neutrogenia is a little bit more of an art of how to optimize those spelling changes and make you better so this concept nature versus nurture right so nature is really your genetic blueprint and the nurture piece is your lifestyle right how are you going to live to optimize that and there's this saying which I don't really love but there's no better one your genetics load the gun and your lifestyle

pulls the trigger so really it's that's the most Epi means above genetics so how you live what you eat how you exercise how you handle stress all of that whether you're sleeping not sleeping is far more important um because again just the blueprint but diet is the single most important influencer of your genes okay now food is not just fuel it really is information so if you're going to put in poor information you're going to get poor quality output I like to tell this story um

because it it really made things real for me in this in this realm a few years back you know I'm working on Zoom now mostly and um my computer was totally taken over you know one of these like frozen moments flashing and call this number and so I call the number and they're like just give us control and we'll you know pay us $300 and we'll unlock your computer and protect you from all the hackers and so I was like okay totally but I needed my computer unlocked and I just realized like we are

this such a complex you know biochemical computer and you know if we're putting poor information in then we also can get hacked we get the malware we get the viruses so it's really really important and this is really so inflammation is really the name of the game right so we want to manage inflammation acute inflammation is you you know your immune system online instant there's a problem it usually hurts maybe you need to go to the ER and that's okay because it's signaling that there's a very real issue

but chronic inflammation is where now you have this low steady state irritation in your body that needs to be addressed and that leads to Cascade of problems and there are some some genes that I can look at to to see if the inflammation is active it's really important when I'm going over um a Neutrogena test to see is it actually real for you because you're not just a bunch of data right you're not just a bunch of numbers and letters it has to also clinically correlate to what's

going on in your life but these are all the different things right sleep deprivation dehydration the artificial sweeteners are just awful smoking processed food now Dairy is a huge po we'll talk about that Sugar wheat trans fats vegetable oil you guys you're going to hear many people today talk about vegetable oil the seed oils are literally hands down the worst thing you could put in your body MSG preservatives alcohol you know let's be mindful with that molds Plastics this this this is a

huge thing to consider um some people don't detoxify well and this can have a huge impact and then electromagnetic frequencies so our goal is not just to live longer right live live to maybe be a centenarian or Beyond but to have you know not just great lifespan but have great health span so you want to you know if we if we um if we do our part we can live well beyond the sort of average age of 78 if we do our part okay and you know we're sort of fascinated with these centenarians that like what what are

they doing and um this comes from Dr Peter AA who I admire very much but you know these are uh five components that he he says are the most important pieces to health span so we've got nutrient sensing versus autophagy which is that protein cleansing that happens when you fast it's when you don't eat so what do you when you're eating what are you putting in and then what's happening when you're not eating and then your mitochondrial function is it efficient is it damaged right so cancer cell is

damaged and and then management of inflammation right reactive oxygen species this is super important your insulin sensitivity and glucose disposal and then this is stem cells versus Zombie cells like dead cells in your body where autophagy can kind of clean those up so a couple things we know for sure about longevity is that social support is actually the most important thing for living a very healthy life okay um we also know for sure that caloric restrictions so just eating a lot less and so fasting is really important for

living longer and that as I mentioned diet is the biggest epigenetic influencer of your genes and can influence up to four generations down the road so this is huge for parents right and you know we have a very renowned fertility dock here so this is super important that what you eat both both the the mother and the father it influences down the road so what's DNA DNA it's present and nearly every cell in your body and it's important to note that 99.9% of us are all the same right but in this 0.1 of

differences we have 3 to four million DNA variations so just to give you a sense wolves and dogs they they also share 99.9% so DNA is just a language I of consider myself an interpreter and I'm constantly learning because this is very new science um and it's it's just spelling changes I don't you know we we say it's mutations or variations but it's a strong word and um it when you look at this these three images goat boat and coat those are three very different things and all you've done is one spelling

change so that's a lot like you know reading reading the DNA okay and that's what it these are three people and oops and we just have this one spelling change makes all the difference so um when we're looking at something wild type is what's considered normal so most of the population has that then there's heterozygous and homozygous but as I said before this the gene Snips that I'm looking at we they're they're very malleable genes they're not fixed genes they not high high impact some are a

little higher impact than others like an Appo e Gene but you want to look together at them like families okay family groups and that is where a story gets told you know words get put together like sentences and then paragraphs this is an interesting one though this one is a higher impact the the cagen because it can impact um the difference in how people train okay so protein and you heard Maria speak about it yesterday protein is supremely important it comes from a Greek word word meaning first place so

there are a bunch of there are a bunch of interesting Jee Snips to look together there on how you may do with say e whether red me can actually spike your glucose or not um or whether bacon you know is okay for you or not um or whether you need more fish in your diet now carbohydrates are kind of confusing to people they don't understand that carbohy are really all the plant foods and they're broken out into three major categories we've got sugars starches and fiber and um and it's true about the fiber we

don't really digest it well but for some people who have issues with their gut bacteria it actually is helpful so that that may be a point of disagreement that I may have with some of my colleagues but um and there's some other Gene Snips where fiber the the green leafies are actually pretty helpful especially if you have issues with methylation so um but all people who are this is the one area where we can agree we want to remove sugars and starches in when we're doing a low carb ketogenic plan and these are just some

Gene Snips to look at um tcf7l2 is a higher impact Gene regarding grains and diabetes and this one is uh correlated to um Amala so the breakdown the ability to break down those carbohydrates starting in the mouth so fats all right um we literally will go crazy or die because essential fatty acids means that the body does not make them and so we need them from our diet and your brain is 60% fat um Omega three is essential for proper cellular communication and fat produces all of our hormones okay there's so such

confusion around cholesterol and um we you know we're just that's something a conversation I feel like I have every single day so these are just and these are you know some of the the letters I look at with regards to F those are just some of them now it's really interesting so the Ino are the only population on planet Earth who uh cannot get into ketosis okay so they're the only only and they actually follow a ketogenic plan but the reason so their genes evolved right to prevent it so

that they wouldn't get too lean so literally that means that everybody else on planet Earth can do keto now you may may have some issues with par PP which um is this Gene and this this whole family of PE part is all important for fat usage so some people who have variants here really benefit from supplementing with lcarnitine because ELC carnitine is something that shuttles your fatty acids into the mitochondria to help you be more efficient and some people who are great with Pare are really great with endurance

exercise because they have better V2 Max and literally there are no Olympians who don't have what we call the Olympian genes so that's all potential right so if you exercise your potential then you know you can optimize this is a this is a newer one to me and um newer one to the test I use mtnr1b it's it's about melatonin it's a melatonin receptor Gene and this has been shown to have very very strong impact on your insulin sensitivity especially if you eat late at night higher risk so there's newer

research on early Tim restricted feeding that it's beneficial to uh stop eating even by 2: or 3: or 4:00 p.m. and that's pretty hard to do it's terrible for socializing but if you can kind of uh use that more often in your life and and stop eating earlier um I mean I I've eaten late my whole life just you know we we grew up in Europe and and my family likes to eat late and it's it's it's hard to break that pattern so I struggle with that myself but I've been do doing more of that that lately and I

actually feel feel really good when I do it okay coffee so right yes we heard about how terrible coffee is yesterday um so there is a there there is a distinction between the slow metabolizer and the Fast metabolizer and the fast metabolizer is what we call a mutation okay it's it's actually an anomaly um but people with the uh that genotype it's AA actually will reap the benefits of the antioxidants from the coffee and feel good now I'm not saying drink you know 10 cups of coffee a day that's not

good um and you also want to correlate it to a CGM and see if coffee really is spiking your blood sugar and causing a problem or does it kick you out of ketosis if you're measuring that which you should be so um but for the CC type okay the slow metabolizer they'll get anxious they'll have the heart palpitations and they won't feel good okay they really won't and so you can sort of clinically correlate now a lot of people sort of already know that about themselves like oh coffee really

doesn't make me feel that good and I and I get angsty and I feel weird and they avoid it maybe they they switch to something else but there's a reason why okay Dairy so this this Gene is correlated to um lactose and something called lactase persistence which is weird right we're supposed to you know be weaned off of milk by ag6 okay so it is also an adaptation a mutation to be able excuse me to uh break down Dairy so little 3/4 of the planet does not do well on Dairy and this is a big confusion in the

in the keto world because you know um I know when I bump up against just regular folks they're like uh keto they just have this idea that we're just all eating a boatload of cream cheese and sour cream and and and you really shouldn't be doing that anyway because it is pretty inflammatory now uh you know smaller amounts of cheese or dairy it's okay and it's interesting because one of my parents uh should not be having Dairy the other one is totally adapted for dairy and so I landed in the middle and

I love dairy by the way so it's it's a little bit of you know it's a crutch to have the dairy to help you along in your ketogenic plan but just check also again correlate to how you feel and are you getting no skin breakouts and things like that so there's a bunch of mental health genes that I look at in my report as well and um you know these are all super important to optimize as well right we have we have almost like a depression and anxiety epidemic in our country as well mostly because the diet is so poor

but um there's there's places to optimize here as well okay so detoxification is a whole pathway that I also look at in my report and these are your five major detoxification pathways um now it's interesting right because there are some centenarians that smoke and they live to be 105 and and it's and it's weird right we know that smoking is not healthy but that is good genetic clearance that's all it is okay it's not because we know that's really bad for us but that is

really fast detoxification at work okay so environmental toxic toity this is super important and not to be discounted so your cookware is very very not just what you eat but what you're cooking on is very very important to consider um literally a true story I I was talking about this and I talked about Teflon toxic toxicosis which is what you know off gassing of of the Teflon um from your non-stick cookware and it can kill a pet bird right cuz like Canary and the coal mine situation and literally this this this young woman

came up to me and she goes now I know what happened to my bird like I just didn't know if I I killed my bird and um and it it it you can tell maybe you have like an air filter and you cook with something air filter turns on so I I encourage you to to change up that cookware and also invest in a good air filter um we have a a molecule and it's wonderful there's a test that I run if you are a stubborn clinical case like you're eating well you know you're doing all the things but something's not right

you got to go deeper so there is a good you know to check for toxic load and this is this is also a very fascinating topic that you know um I could spend a whole half hour on here but mold and M toxins um are are something also newer in the Health Community that is really getting more attention and you know there is mold present in Foods so anything stored dry like grains beans um yes coffee can be moldy so you do want to buy coffee that has been um sort of cleansed of that and um and this is also there's there's urine testing

for this that I do as well it's um great if again stubborn cases especially with skin issues so if you're not getting the results that you want you know you want to see if it's a hormone imbalance are you eating the wrong foods for you maybe you have sensitivities maybe you do have environmental toxicity maybe it's malabsorption right you know um got bacteria you have a lot of external life stressors who doesn't have that and then this piece not eating for your genetic code and you want to put all these

things together right because you are a complex puzzle a very Advanced biochemical being so thank you so much um
