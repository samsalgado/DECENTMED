    <div className='pr'>
    <p>
    “Cancer Cases, Deaths in Men Predicted to Surge by 2050”. Currently, cancer is responsible for 1 in 5 deaths in the world. There is no cure for cancer, and statisticians expect cancer deaths to rise. What if I told you that the cure to cancer is found in the foods we eat? The number one fast food chain in the world is McDonald’s. “Canola oil was first created in the early 1970s as a natural oil. But in 1995, Monsanto created a genetically modified version of canola oil. By 2009, over 90 percent of the Canadian canola oil crop was genetically engineered (1).” Dr. Sebi theorized that seed oils are carcinogenic once heated. Let’s explore the relationship between food, cancer, and fruits with powerful preventive properties.

    <div className='pr'>
        <p>
        The process of acupuncture is a four-step process beginning with checking the pulse and other vitals. Then, insert the needles into acupuncture points or points where blood, lymph, and nerves can easily access connective tissue. Next, manipulate the needles, and sometimes moxibustion is applied. Moxibustion is a traditional Chinese medical technique that involves burning the herb mugwort to relieve cold or stagnant conditions by stimulating circulation. Finally, topical patches and herbal rub are applied to the post-need injection sites.

        <p>
        To better understand Hypnotherapy we must first understand Hypnosis. Hypnosis is a natural, yet slightly altered, state of mind where communication and responsiveness with the subconscious mind is present. Hypnosis is being in a state of hypersuggestibility with an increased receptivity to suggestion. This state allows the hypnotherapist to better facilitate communication between the conscious and the subconscious mind.

The "War on Drugs" was a collosal failure in the United States; Oregon decriminalized drugs in its state. However, this decision hasn't worked either, resulting in rampant drug use, overdose, homelessness and fentanyl deaths. Pain pills, or opioids have a long history of abuse and addiction. "In 2022, over 107,000 people died of a drug overdose, with 75% of those deaths involving an opioid." According to WebMD: "Estimated 3 million Americans suffer from OUD (Opioid Use Disorder)". Chiropractors take a holistic perspective, the body can heal itself. Chiropractic techniques are 40% more effective than medical care for lower back pain. Suffering from back pain?
