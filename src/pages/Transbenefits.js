Ramona Crabtree Faulner. I'm the owner of Authentic Life Journey. I'm a transformational empowerment coach, speaker, author, and retreat facilitator. So, I have been working in the holistic wellness field for over 20 years. Started out as massage therapist, worked my way into yoga and meditation and energy work. And over that time I had my own journey that I experienced of healing and growth and expansion that included uh you know dropping into spaces of needing to break through hustle mentality and burnout. And as I

was doing that I began to find that the women that were showing up to receive the services I had to offer were the same. They were burnt out. They were overwhelmed. They were feeling stuck. and they were needing tools to help them move forward in life in a more authentic way. So throughout my 20 years, I started out just kind of hustling. And then once I shifted and started moving into living authentically, what I found was all of the tools that I needed in order to ground myself, to align with

myself, and ultimately to understand that I'm in charge of that alignment, no one else. So that means that I have to work on my thoughts and my feelings and um and what my expectations were and to really become the living embodiment of what it is that I was teaching. Uh so ultimately what that did is it created a a safe container for me to get really clear about what it is that I wanted to do to support other women. And so I work with professional women that are burnt out, overwhelmed, or feeling stuck

because those were the women that were knocking at my door all along. So as I've honed my craft in coaching and and retreats, I have found that there's been so much joy in supporting this community of women to find their way back home. And I think it's a combination of both. I think we we become burnt out because we're operating on systems that are outdated, that were taught to us when we were much younger, that maybe weren't in alignment. They weren't the right necessary um practices that would lead

you to having a more authentic life experience. So, I think healing is uh what comes whenever you are breaking through burnout. Uh I I I don't see it as two separate things. I think it's all in in union with one another as is yoga. It's union. Burnout comes when we're misaligned from our truth. So we can get into situations uh where we operate in a in a a position and we've allowed oursel from the beginning of moving into that position to say yes to things that maybe should have been a no. So then there's

expectations that are expected to be met because in the beginning you said yes or maybe it was a no. So, I have a client that she switched uh jobs twice while she was working with me. The first um time, the first job she left, she was like, "I'm done. Peace out. I don't want to do this anymore." So, she just jumped to the next the next thing that she thought was aligned. And it was aligned, but not in the way that she thought it was. what it actually was was her opportunity to

break through some of the behaviors that that got her into spaces of burnout before. So even though the the middle job wasn't the job, we did so much work with her while she was in that middle job to learn to say no, to step back, to meditate daily, to journal daily, to make sure that she was creating sacred self-care time. And even though she hit a lower level of burnout with the middle job, it wasn't the same because she was she was applying things differently and she was she was approaching it

differently. instead of just being, you know, the go-to yes girl, she was able to ultimately use that time to learn herself, learn who she was and how she wanted to be represented. And so then when she finally landed in the the dream job, which is where she's at now, she's been able to be more intentional with her with her energy and how she's showing up and what she's saying yes to and what she's saying no to. She's been willing to say, "I'm going to take a vacation. I'm going to do the things

that I need to do for myself instead of always being on." healing journey story is having a childhood that was built on belief structures that were about working hard and always having to push in order to get what you wanted out of life. I I was in maledominated fields from the time I was about 8 years old. So playing baseball, working in technical theater, working uh in a a technical side at a audiovisisual company and then once I eventually found my way to becoming a massage therapist, that's when things

really began to change for me because those kinds of journeys um diving into education and and understanding the body and the energy and the mind and the emotions is not something that you even I even knew was happening until it was already there. So as I was going along, it was just this natural progression that once I moved into yoga and energy work, then I began to pay more attention to what was going on that wasn't working. Uh eventually I ended up having some medical events. I had a a tumor on my thyroid in 2012 that I had

to have my thyroid removed because uh there was no other way to remove the tumor. It had to I had they had to take the organ. And so as I began to dive into the energetics of that, it became very clear to me that my lack of ability to have an authentic voice was the, you know, ultimately physical manifestation of the tumor was accessible. So when we're out of alignment with our our truths and our our values and who we really are and we're operating outside of that, the physical body is the last

place that we begin to see those misalignments. So it's about becoming more mindful, more intentional, more aware, and and learning to ask myself questions about whether or not this is right for me. And so as I did that, it empowered me. It empowered me to say no where I needed to say no and say yes where I needed to say yes. And it empowered me to let go of um parts of my business model that were not serving me anymore, that were actually causing me harm. So because of that, it enabled me to be able to cultivate these

tools that I now teach to others. Mindfulness is actively um creating behaviors and movements forward with intention and purpose and when we do that we can have visions of our future. So you know you had mentioned earlier that the that it keeps us from being in the future. Yes. And when I am holding a vision for my for my life, it where we get in trouble is when we are we are expecting that that vision to be right now instead of I'm holding this vision and I'm moving my energy towards that vision.

Right? And as I'm moving my energy towards that vision, I want to make sure every single day I am stepping onto the path on purpose towards that vision. So, anything that I'm doing that is misaligned with that is going to cause that process to to start dragging a little bit. So, I want to wake up every day and apply the practices and the tools that are going to help me remain intentional with my energy, remain intentional with my word, remain intentional with my actions, and to move my life forward with a presence of mind

and not allowing the chaos of my mind to be taking me in 5,000 different places. So my hope is that when we enter into a relationship with one another, a coach and client or retreat facilitator and participant, is that my participants and clients feel like they're in a safe container to self-explore and connect to their higher knowing because they have all of the answers. I mean the very first thing that I always teach is uh to become a you know we have to start developing awareness. If we're just

moving through life and muddling through it and running on the hamster wheel and not really becoming more present with ourself then we don't really have the the baseline to make changes. So the very first thing that I always teach is to start becoming aware of what's not working, what it is that you need to give attention to to allow yourself to have more um more power to do something about it. Uh in addition, I my number one tool is breathe. You know, like if you're not breathing, that is raising your tension level. that

is causing the anxiety in the body to rise. And so we want to make sure that we're using our breath to help settle ourselves and bring oursel back into the present moment. So I keep using that word back in the present moment. So mindfulness is about being in the here and now and not being five steps ahead or five steps behind. And that is something that I cultivated through practicing yoga because when you're on the mat the intention is to be present with the aa to be present with the breath to be present with the moment

that you are in right now because that's the only moment that exists. So the more that we can learn to be in the current moment, then that gives us the ability to um address anything that's showing up that isn't in the current moment. So I had a client just recently that was we kind of dialed into how they got upset about something and I said, "Okay, walk me through the process that got you there." And they said, "Well, you know, like it's a thought that comes in and it goes

away and then like 10 minutes later I'm I'm I'm chewing on it and thinking about it and and I'm like, "Okay, and where was that moment? Was it a story you were telling yourself that is going to happen or was it a sitting in the past and thinking about something that didn't work out the way you wanted it to?" Neither one of those ends of the spectrum are in the present moment. So we have to bring oursel back to here and be like, okay, what is it that is going on that is causing me to be worried

about this or causing me to to sit in this this space of judging myself because of something that I did. That's what you have power over in that moment is begin beginning beginning to explore what it is that you need in this moment that's going to help you let go of the need to control or or stay stuck in in one of those other moments. So, as far as yoga for for my programming, it's part of the program. I I do align it to the energy body so that it's really about cultivating that

theme. And so, you know, I I do grounding practice. I do a a creative like get into your fl your your watery energy, your your creative energy. Or when we get into our solar plexus, really helping cultivate our sense of of identity and empowerment and presence with oneself. When we get into the heart, we're we're working into opening the heart and and loving ourselves first and then everyone else. Uh throat has to do with communication and speaking clearly and being authentic with our word. Uh when we get into the third eye,

we're we're really dialing into the energetics of our inner wisdom, our inner knowing, and being present with that and not allowing oursel to make decisions based on somebody else's want or need of us. And um lastly, when we get into the crown, we're just remembering that we're one with source and that we're not creating this life by oursel. We're actually co-creating it. So my yoga practices are very gentle. They're very intentional. They're they're focused on a very specific

theme, but it all comes back to mindfulness. It all comes back to being present. Yeah. So, when we can reclaim our energy, we can choose how we're moving that energy forward, right? versus just operating at a rhythm or a a frequency that is someone else's need or the world's want of us. So when I can get aligned with my own energy and and I can I can intentionally move that energy forward, then everything I'm doing is on purpose. And so on purpose has two meanings for me. One, on purpose. I'm

doing it on purpose. And two, on purpose. What is my purpose in this world? And allowing yourself to move that energy forward on purpose. And when we do that, we are empowered, right? We have the ability to be living a life that is truly aligned to ourselves and our authentic voice and our authentic knowing. And then we feel more grounded in who we are. where we can stand in front of a room of a hundred people and speak our truth without fear of having anyone judge us. I just did a talk yesterday and part of my authentic self

is I feel I feel things deeply and I allow that to be seen. I allow that truth and that vulnerability to be seen because what that does is one, it allows the person in the audience to feel seen, heard, and honored because maybe they're feeling something in what I'm saying. They're ex they're they're feeling as if wow if if she can have permission to be authentically herself even cry for a moment in the midst of a conversation or a talk that she's having then I can and that's the magic in living

authentically is when I can just be myself authentically what that does is it allows everyone around me to rise up into that awareness that they can have it too. Retreats are different um session to session and and in fact my the future of my retreats is transforming once again. So I have been leading retreats for uh 15 years and they have all been in one opportunity after another for me to grow and expand as a practitioner as a person that can hold a safe sacred container. And um essentially I start every retreat

out with grounding in. So intentionally bring our bringing oursel into the moment. And then there's different experiences. So maybe we are traveling to have an excursion or maybe we are doing meditation or yoga. Um we do a lot of sacred circles, sound healing. And so each day is different. It's based on a theme over the entire container. So each container is different based on the experience that we're having. So the current retreat that I have is going to be in Montana in September. And so it's

called Roots of the Wild Soul. So it's really about getting back in touch with mother nature, getting back in touch with the wildness. and and we're we're actually going to Yellowstone for a day and and we we're going to be in the midst of the wild because every every being that lives on that land is is wild. They they are not being contained. They are not being guided or or put into a space that they are not allowed to to move. They are going anywhere and everywhere that is aligned for them

their their life. And so experiencing that is a mirror back to oneself of okay, where do I need to be moving freely? Where have I put myself in a container that I can't and how do we open that up? So that that's really the the overall experience of every retreat. It's let's embody the experience we're having in this space and what that space represents. Uh, and each each place I take my clients to is a different experience. So, there's no one-sizefits-all when it comes to my

retreats. It's really really intentional. Um, we're we're in the process of preparing for our first international retreat. And that process is going to be a completely different experience compared to everything else I've ever done. I think it's um how I approach it. So, I as a transformational empowerment coach use holistic practices to teach my clients how to better navigate their lives in a way that is more mindful, intentional, and authentic. So, that's the transformational piece.

The empowerment piece, which we touched on before, was having these tools allows them to navigate things that are not working instead of just feeling stuck in not knowing what to do. Instead, now they know how to use these tools that I've taught them to self-explore, to evaluate something before answering, to ground themselves, to understand when they're taking on energy outside of their their themselves that's not theirs. So, it's it's learning to know themsself that empowers

them. It's the whole journey, right? So I feel so connected to who I am because of the self-work that I have done over the past 20 years. Uh because I broke through the barriers and the veils of illusion and the behavioral patterns that were not mine. They were somebody else's idea of what was meant to make me successful or do good or whatever whatever words it is that belongs to each person. We all have different words. For me, it was being liked, being wanted, being um being good enough. Like

those were the things that kept me stuck in the behavioral patterns that weren't working. When I finally realize that I'm the only one that can decide my value and that when I align to knowing that value, then anything that I do that is out of alignment with that value blows up in my face. It becomes problematic. So I want to do less and less of that and more of more of what feels like Ramona, what feels like this lights me up. This it this inspires me. This is onbrand with my purpose and my passion

and my inspirations in life. When I do the things that are aligned to those areas, the sky's is the limit. When I say yes to something that is absolutely not, that is when I things blow up. So my why is I've been there. I was I was that I was the person that was burnt out, overwhelmed, and stuck. I didn't know who I was. I was operating in someone else's ideas of what was my value and my success. And so, because of that, because I was able to do that work and and return home, and that doesn't

mean the work is over. I'm I'm constantly gifted the opportunities to dial in a little bit more, become more connected to that authentic truth. But because I did that, I feel so passionate to help others do the same because I know the value of it. And having coached as long as I have, I see the success in my clients that have done the work. It's glorious. It's inspiring. and it it aligns with feeling like my purpose is being met. So, there's layers depending upon what commitment level someone wants to

have, but the the short answer is it's a four-month program uh that has an online component and uh there are a couple different options that can be done with coaching alongside of it or you can um you can explore it on your own. uh the coaching alongside of it, it it allows you the opportunity to meet with me and we dial into whatever it is you've explored in between the sessions. It allows me to help you see how to integrate what I'm teaching you in real time. So, I had a client recently that

uh she's about halfway through my program and she came in and she was having this issue and she was like, "And I don't really know what to do about it and I was like, "All right, let's go back to lesson one and I want you to explore some things in lesson one because that's what's going to help you bring awareness to what it is that's going on that will then help you step into your power." So, having the the onetoone coaching alongside of the online program ultimately is there to

help you learning how learn how to integrate what it is that I'm teaching you. And that's a really important part of the process that's not for everyone. So, at the end of the day, you have to find which which uh space aligns with you. And I'm I'm just here to help make sure that you are uh being held in a safe container to do that work. So, the quiz is meant for you to kind of just go through and see see where you are, see if you're feeling where you're feeling stuck and how stuck you are

feeling. And at the end of the quiz, uh, once you finish it, you get a a landing page and an email that dials into what level of stuckness you're at and my suggestions of how you might begin to shift that. It's a first step. It's a first opportunity and it's a free resource to check in with where you're at. I have guidance. I have wisdom to pass over. I have a lantern I will walk beside them with. You have all of the answers.
