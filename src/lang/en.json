  "Have you ever wondered how people used to live healthier and longer lives? Before traditional medicine, there was wellness. Our ancestors experienced vitality - living off the land. This decade has uncovered the hidden truth about traditional healthcare. Medicine is not about surviving; it is about wellness. Medicine should cure sometimes, relieve often, and comfort always. Our goal is to promote vitality. We are personally and professionally invested in the re-emergence of regenerative medicine and broadening access to revolutionary therapies. Treatments like homeopathy operate on the belief that the body can heal via plants and minerals to stimulate the healing process.": "Have you ever wondered how people used to live healthier and longer lives?

  "Back pain stems from many factors — including nerve damage, injury, posture, lack of mobility, and straining. The sacral nerve controls many functions, including motor function to the pelvic region, bowels and bladder function. Constipated individuals often have a damaged sacral nerve. Doctors can insert a device into the rectum to stimulate a bowel movement. Functional medical doctors theorize that the body is an interconnected system. Many diseases are warning signs for detrimental problems; the body can heal itself and cannot heal when it is fighting itself.

  "After Stacy graduated from San Diego State University in 1992, she moved to the Detroit area and began her career in sales and marketing. She traveled the world and climbed the corporate ladder. But something was missing. Before long, she was back to her studies – this time in Ayurvedic Medicine. Her own journey to health and healing, through Ayurveda, had already begun a few years earlier -- when she was a patient with her own chronic health conditions. When she had the opportunity to deepen her knowledge, she jumped at the chance. At first, it was from an academic standpoint. She couldn’t wrap her mind around how it all worked. After hours and years of study and residency, she found the answers she sought. Then, her mission was clear – she needed to teach others how to HEAL & TRANSFORM their own lives through Ayurveda, the 'wisdom of life.": "After Stacy graduated from San Diego State University in 1992, she moved to the Detroit area and began her career in sales and marketing.
