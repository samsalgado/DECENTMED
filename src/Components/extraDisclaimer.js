  <p>Happy to connect but before we jump on a call, I did check out DecentMed's website. I might have met the Founder briefly, I cannot remember.</p>
  <p>
    As I was reviewing the public facing content, I noticed several references to mental health or emotional wellness that might be unintentionally overstepping clinical boundaries or could be misinterpreted as treatment claims.

  </p>
  <p> I am mentioning this, not as professional gatekeeping, but because healthcare-specific messaging, especially around mental health, does need to be grounded in licensed expertise and evidence-based language. </p>

  <p> Without it, it can raise a lot of compoliance and credibility concerns--
    both for DecentMed and the marketing agency's affiliation with the content.  </p>
  <p>All information comes from holistic providers and coaches. We do not make any treatment claims. Any claim information is validated by providerÂ studies</p>
