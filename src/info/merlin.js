      So for all the practitioners, you understand a little bit about decent med, what it is, you might have a better understanding of how it can help you, but you still have questions. So what we're going to do today is we're going to go step by step with Ingreda on the process of what it looks like to be a part of decent bed from A all the way to Z. And then we're also gonna have a little fourm minute presentation that's a demo of our CRM. She's gonna go to the signup page. >> Yes, sign up.

>> She's going to click on provider. >> Provider. >> So now, as you see, this is our sign up page. In order to sign part of the platform, you put your name, your email, you ask for a password. And if she scrolls down, you'll see that we have two tiers. But before getting into the tiers, what you want to know as a provider is how does it work and how is it going to help me grow? So let's get out of this page and go to the homepage. The first element of our platform is that we

tailor people's conditions towards you the provider's modality. People might not know what homeopathy or naturopathy is, but they know when they have gut issues. They know when they have cancer. They know when they have their condition. So go to conditions and pick any condition you want. >> Okay, I'm going to pick cancer. >> So she goes to cancer. So according to statistics, 15 million people die of cancer each year globally. In order to validate the effectiveness of not only

these treatments but also of alternative cancer treatments so that you are an informed consumer, we post provider studies and we have four cancer documentaries on our platform. two are dissertations and two are legitimate case studies. So, you might be thinking, well, what if I don't practice cancer? What if I'm just a traditional naturopath or a health coach? Well, that's totally fine if she goes up to the top, goes back to conditions, and just pick another one. >> Okay, I pick trauma.

So as she goes to trauma, like I mentioned before, a lot of people don't know what naturopathy is, but a lot of people struggle with trauma. So in order to highlight what you do and how you help people, first of all, as you see on the right, there's Dr. Kristen Barnes naturopathy. So, in order to validate not only your treatment method, which we'll get to in a second, but to highlight your expertise, we offer showcase shows and interviews to all providers for your teleaalth listing as

well as for these pages. Now, scroll down. >> So, again, people want evidence. So, if you click on naturopathy case study, you'll see that we post provider case studies. And you might be thinking, well, what if I don't have any case studies? Well, if you scroll up a little bit, you'll see there's other ways we can highlight your expertise, whether it's with reviews or just with the things that you're teaching. We want to validate that your treatment method works. So, by posting your case

studies, and it's nothing crazy. It really is what was the patient struggling with, what was your me methodology, what were the results, what are your final thoughts and that's it. It can be very simple. So now once the patient has determined that naturopathy works and they have trauma well now what do they do? So if you click on that button try naturopathy >> you'll see that you can have access to naturopathic providers in your area >> because with naturopathy it's tellahalthbased so put your location in

there. >> Okay I'll put you Robin. >> So you might be thinking well what if we don't have any providers in Europe. Well the way that naturopathy works it doesn't have to be locationbased. You can get naturopathy from Dr. Terresa Vulner who's a naturopathic doctor that helps to lower your blood sugar or you can have traditional naturopathic medicine from Meridian Passage Wellness with Dr. Kristen Barnes. Well, now how do they actually access you? Well, we have two ways that you can

get in touch with a provider. The second way we'll get into in a minute with the demo, but the first way is that we embed your calendar or if you just want it simple, you can call the provider itself. So if you click on that book tellaalth session, you're able to call Kristen Barnes directly and have access to her office and then maybe you're a provider that just has a program. Well, if you scroll up, you'll see that with Dr. Teresa Vulner, she just has a program. So if you click join today, it will go to her

program. >> Well, what if you want to utilize our CRM? So we have a 100% HIPPA compliant CRM that works for billing, insurance. It it has a bunch of templates and we can manage it all for you. >> Hello and welcome to this demo of Care Patreon. Care Patreon is a HIPPA compliant CRM. As you see here, this is the calendar view. You can set up different workspaces for people's locations. We also have an inbox and a way to communicate with clients within a CRM. You can add different tags like

tellaalth, referral, intake, couple, assessment, and more. You can also assign different team members to each client. Next is the billing section. So with our CRM, we do have Stripe enabled, but you can also send invoices where people can pay you directly if you want to have everything inhouse. They can pay you with a bank transfer or they can pay you in cash and you can just mark it as paid so that within the CRM you have the ability to track everything. Most importantly is insurance. So as far

as claims, you can create a new claim for the client. You can also add existing claims and this helps with insurance billing as well as sending invoices with potential clients. You can add the services. We have embedded the codes for chiropractic. But if you are in a different modality that's not chiropractic, we can still add the codes in for you as well. As you see here, we sent an invoice to Bobby Doe and these are the methods in which he can pay. Next is the templates. So, there's a lot of different

templates. One is the DX codes, especially if you're a chiropractor. So, these are all 2025 DX codes. We also have templates for notes. And again, this is not just chiropractic. If you're a nutritionist, an acupuncturist, we have notes and templates for so many different things. Neck disability disability indexes. As you see here, we have over 7,500 resources, almost 8,000. So, if we type in chiropractic, we have five current resources, but there's a bunch of other tools as well. Treatment

plans, intake forms, and so much more. So now let me walk you through the setup when you first create your account. And one thing to note is that we can create an account for you on our platform or set it up for you. It's really up to you. So you can set a physical location and a virtual location. In this instance, the chiropractor chose to have everything within one workspace. I've had other practitioners operate with different workspaces as you see there. So for Dr. Terresa VNER for example, she

has a winners in diabetes that's 100% virtual. So we can embed her Zoom and as it scales, we'll transfer that over to her other business, Total Care Health Solutions. Another thing that you definitely want to do is set your services. Like I brought up earlier, we have the DX codes, so you can set your services. You can also assign those services to different teams. You can have galleries for images for your services so you can brand yourself. You can set up online payments. Uh again, Stripe is completely

enabled. You can assign different team members and this is how it would actually look. So if we go and copy the link, we can also embed it and I'll show you that in a minute. But if you copy the link and you go to a separate page, you'll see that a complete portal is set up for you so that you can book with the practitioner. Set a different time. You can set your time in care patreon at any message that you want to give and that's how you do the booking. Now let me show you how to book within decent med itself. So within

decent med in your teleahalth portal we've embedded that same calendar set the date continue request booking add your name your last name your email and any message that you want to give and we also have the ability to call the practice directly. So the final element of the platform is connecting the patients with the providers with our apothecary. So if you go to the apothecary, you'll see that we have over 150 plants on our apothecary. Our goal is that we give providers stake in our global apothecary.

As the apothecary scales, providers will be able to have insurance. The buyin is very simple from a patient perspective. You have an ailment. We have plans that are much more effective than pills. Every single plant on our apothecary has legitimate sources with at least five to 10 studies for each plant all verified by PFAF. And that is the platform and a as a whole. It is we are helping you with getting patients. We are managing your system. We're validating your expertise and growing you and highlighting your expertise over

time. I really was drawn to your vision of how you can help people with this type of platform.
