const transcriptText = `today we have Dr Tim Shannon tell the audience a little bit about yourself yeah so I'm a naturopath in practice since 2021 uh have done a number of different kinds of treatment modalities over those years I um probably the whole time the whole 23 or so years I've been using something called Homeopathy for treating patients but then also I did a number of years of doing intervenous therapy with many cancer patients but then our Clinic IV Therapeutics have become prohibitively expensive and challenging for a number

of reasons so our clinics stopped allowing IV treatments probably eight or nine years ago and then I also treat a lot of cancer patients using an array of different kinds of off Lael drugs and supplements trying to Target their metabolic vulnerabilities and then probably my day-to-day practice I see you know your migraines your insomnia your anxiety patients they're the day-to-day patients and then I also have a lot of uh chronic what's referred to as complex multimorbid patients which is

now become ubiquitous there's probably 50% of my patient base are patients that have three or more chronic Health complaints I know you mentioned that you're a naturopath a lot of people get that confused and they also get herbal medicine confused with Homeopathy so can you just touch on the difference between the three please well naturopathic medicine is sort of a an umbrella kind of alternative provider in the United States and they also have naturopaths in Europe and other countries I believe although there

may be some differences between the United States and those European countri in this country we have licensed naturopaths who go through a four-year medical education and we have to do um like kadaver lab and we have to do pharmacology and we have to go through training that's very similar actually to what the conventional uh medical patient or physician goes through probably the biggest difference between a naturopathic health care provider or physician and a conventional provider is the application of treatments so in the

conventional World oriented towards symptom resolution using surgeries many different Pharmaceuticals are probably their bread and butter and radiation for sure if you cancer treatment and then there's sunry other treatments around that but those are the bulk of their interventions in the naturopathic Realm we're using treatments like supplements herbal medicine homeopathic medicine um different kinds of manipulation cranial sacral therapy acupuncture ortic medicine I mean there's a pretty broad

array of different tools that naturopaths can use depending on their own particular um inclination um and then it the naturopathic realm you can divise treatments into different subtypes so you have treatments that also are mostly going to look at symptom resolution um and I'd say that's a large portion of naturopathic care as well meaning if somebody has a q pain or something they you know they may a naturopath May prescribe an enade like ibuprofen or they may prescribe an herb that they know well or series of herbs

or a mixture of herbs or they may prescribe anti-inflammatory proteolytic enzymes things like Broman um cepas different enzymes that Chew in to inflammation or they may prescribe um high doses of omega-3 fatty acids because those will often blunt pain or inflammation um so even though they're natural agents they're meant more or as a in the moment or acute use to Res resolve symptoms they have some similarity with the conventional world except for you're using natural agents to try to get the same benefit um or

similar benefit um and then you also have another whole subset which is called diet and lifestyle medicine which is that many patients that struggle with chronic disease nowadays um one could say their health complaints are fed unbeknownst to them by a poor diet or being sedentary too much it's a huge part of medicine is diet and lifestyle medicine so that's another subset is talking about people's blood sugar and their metabolism and that's often done in a way with naturopathic care which

can resolve chronic complaints there are many chronic complaints I mean diabetes is an obvious one but there's an array of many other chronic Health complaints that patients suffer from if they're well counseled and in their diet and lifestyle challenges and use blood work to help kind of anchor where some of the problems are a lot of people can be relieved or or at least significantly relieved of chronic pain depression just so many different chronic issues having said that I don't want to suggest that

diet and lifestyle is the cure of everything because it's not often times chronic diseases can become pretty complex and system can kind of get on board to kind of keep things stuck and then you need something more precise to really resolve those chronic ailments and then there's treatments that are meant to induce the system to heal itself like Homeopathy acupuncture Chinese medicine or veic medicine to some degree I suspect I less I know less about orotic medicine but those treatment approaches

are meant to correct imbalances that get sort of stuck in the system and once those imbalances get stuck in the system you need something to induce the system to break from that stuck pattern back to normal balance attension deficit disorder or add which is now super common in today's society in children and adults and in the conventional world they're pegging the whole condition to genetics or neurological problems or or some kind of physical phenomena I would suggest that there's other ways to look at things

like add for instance one of the things we know if they're saying that it's genetic then you can look at a population of poor or disadvantaged people children for example they've done many of these studies and compare them to privilege uh children of the same age group and what you see is a wildly higher incidence of ADD and ADHD in the poor group versus the other group and how come that's true if it's just genetics it doesn't make sense um the environment and the milu that those that

we're born into can have a profound crafting effect or or training effect on our ability to maintain good attention Focus for instance you take any young boy or girl and let's say you put him in a home where there's you know uh it's a reasonable family life but in that family two three four times a week the parents are in a loud brawl or row or some kind of argument and that child boy or girl is sitting in their bedroom or sitting in the living room listening to them yelling and screaming at each

other and there may be the most loving parents who are very good at providing for the kids and they got good schools and all that but that those children in that house they don't you know they can't turn that off they can't leave they can't select new parents they have no agency to change their context and so if that's very uncomfortable for that child which makes some sense that that would be one of those kids might look out the window and start spacing out because that's a lot less uncomfortable

than tuning and hearing you know all the words and so on and so it doesn't take a lot to assume that that child if this is happening regularly that child trains themselves in how to space out such that when they go to school for their first year and there's a lot of noise and there's kids screaming and whatever is happening in the school they now have trained themselves to space out and now they're in this place where they have to sit down and focus and now they're at odds with themselves

yeah now somebody's going to tell you that's just a genetic proclivity but when you see the high level of these kids um now being put on ADD drugs I think it could be argued there's a lot of those kids that have already been sort of pre-trained and now their nervous system is sort of trained or entrained into that way of focus and something has to break that pattern if something doesn't internally break that pattern you can use stimulants you can use Concerta you can use rlin you can

use those drugs which force the child to hyperfocus only while the drug is active in their bloodstream but once that drug gets metabolized and Johnny or suie is back to Jumping all over the place and can't focus because that drug is not meant to fix or correct that imbalance at all it's not even the purpose of it the purpose of it is to manage the issue and this is not knocking those drugs there's a lot of people who use them and and find that they work at adults or children it's just that they have a

significant limitation that's rarely discussed which is that you're never fixing that inbalance and Homeopathy has a very high success rate in actually resolving the problem such that most of the kids or adults that I see have these kind of focus or attention issues in a somewhere between a two to six month window they're not only resolved the focus and the behavioral issues and the like we can stop treatment and those improvements remain and that's a very different approach to something where in

some kids you know a lot of kids they're on the drug until they're an adult and you can imagine that's not going to have the greatest effect on their self-esteem because they feel like they're not normal unless they're taking a drug and and you know I don't want to make it sound like Homeopathy is the only option there's other treatment options out there like cranial sacral you can see really successful cranial sa sacral physician they can also break that pattern and allow the child or the adult

to reset their nervous system such that they can stay focused exact same setup that I just described works wonders for chronic pain syndromes which also become reiterative pain signals that the system can't get itself out of migraine headaches sciatica just so many different conditions using Homeopathy you can induce a restoration to normal function and certainly even you know I'm not saying it's magic and works perfectly with everyone there are challenging cases and some failures for sure but dayto day

it's routinely effective in my practice and in many of the Physicians that I teach using this method I don't think it's so much symptom or root I think it's both I think you know because the patient that I see the parents often report within two or three weeks of starting a good medicine they already notice a 15 20% Improvement in over symptoms probably one of the big differences though is if that same child is doing really well on like Focalin or Concerta or stratera often times the parents will

notice a significant Improvement in focus and concentration within a few weeks like a 50 60 70% Improvement in symptoms it's just that they can't have that kind of benefit without the drug using the homeopathic approach it's more incremental so over several months the patient will reach that level of efficacy but then once you see that 80 90% Improvement in focus and behavior in the light you can then start drawing back the homeopathic medicine and the improvements remain exactly the same wow

so it's a different trajectory of treatment and a different purpose a different intention and sometimes the patient is doing you know maybe their ADD symptoms are 50% better but their aggressive behaviors and other symptoms like problem falling asleep aren't really affected by the Focalin or the rlin so in many of those cases I just tell the parent you can maintain the focal in or the drug for whatever benefit it does and then will address using Homeopathy the other remaining symptoms and once those are clearly

improving then we're on a platform where it's not a big deal to back them off the drug because now we've already seen evidence that the deeper nervous system issues are already repairing so you don't have to be off drugs or on drugs succeed with Homeopathy cancer like if if you consider cancer versus non-cancerous cells um non-cancerous cells are healthy cells have an ability to respect the boundaries of the cell wall like they respect the neighborhood you could say so when there's a cell in an healthy

neighborhood of cells in your eye or your arm or wherever or in your organs um and it's starting to grow too large then there are sensors that inside that cell that it can feel the pressure of the sensors surrounding it and then it will use feedback to either fix itself or to even kill itself so it has M because cells are replacing themselves all the time you know we think that we're the same all the time but many of our cells replace themselves within months depending on which cell type it

is the liver the bones Etc it's anywhere from weeks to you know I think seven months might be bone cells so each of the cells are constantly replacing themselves so that means they have programs and instructions to make the cells die off so that new cells can replace them um but but that living healthy cell has the capacity to communicate with the neighboring cells around it and coordinate um whereas a malignant cell and and it also has a very efficient form of feeding itself um and so that means it can get fuel and

build proteins and repair different cell surface areas and different organel parts of the cell that do different work it can do all that work and is efficient in deriving glucose and other nutrients to feed the cell so again we're assuming a healthy cell so when you take a cancer cell that cancer cell no longer communicates successfully with surrounding cells um so that's one characteristic That's Unique so in other words if you have a healthy colony of cells versus a cancerous colony of cells

that cancerous colony of cells can now start growing unregulated over top of and in between healthy cells and inserting itself because it's ignoring or or it's lost the capacity to hear the signaling of the normal healthy cells around it which is what scares us about cancer is because it can grow at such an incredible rate or even just a slow rate but it can overcome many of its neighboring cells and cause damage to the liver or the pancreas or the lung um in such a way that you know now the

patient has problems breathing or their liver function starts to decline um so that's one aspect the other aspect is because a cancer cell uses a a metabolic process that's very efficient it can consume huge amounts of energy that the whole system needs to survive and therefore cause the patient to become very weak and drained um this is more towards the end stage of cancer when the the cancer is really taken over but metabolically because all of those cancer cells are so inefficient they're

just draining the life force out of that patient and then can put that patient in end stage cancer into a state called CIA which is a form of malnutrition where the patient completely loses their appetite at the same time that they're losing skeletal mass and they're becoming profoundly weakened um so cancer has I mean these are very crude estimations of the difference between a malignant cell and a non-cancerous cell but um this gives you some kind of broad ideas um and you know the other

challenge with cancer is it can be growing inside someone and this is not uncommon it's an Insidious process where someone can be slowly having a cancer of the colon for instance and not know it until the cancer is so large that you know they have some constipation or diarrhea and they're lucky enough to see a doctor who orders a test and The Test shows oh my God something really weird then they do imaging and they see this huge mask um so that's the other scary thing about cancer is besides it's a

city nature that it can be building up is that it can rapidly take your life gives you kind of a a basic distinction between non-cancerous cells and cancerous cells there's a drug called Propranolol and Propranolol is a drug that's approved by the FDA or it's on label for hypertension or elevated blood pressure so that's what it's on label for meaning it was approved for many years ago Physicians who were aware noticed that when their patients with Stage Fright for instance they took their Propranolol

before they went on stage they noticed they were conspicuously absent of stage FR and so enough doctors notied this that now they prescribe or we prescribe prolol for stage fright for people that don't have hypertension so that's what they mean by off label because you can legally prescribe any drug in the United States off label for reasons that it wasn't originally tested or approved for I think the estimate is something like 20% of drugs that are prescribed are prescribed off label and probably some

decades ago for instance there's a drug called metformin and Metformin is a drug that's often prescribed for diabetes diabetes type to which is the more typical type of Diabetes it's a fairly benign drug meaning it doesn't seem to cause I mean it can cause muscle pain and diarrhea and some other issues but it's more on the mild side and not very common in my experience because i' prescribed it to I don't know how many patients over the years more for cancer actually than for diabetes but the drug

decades ago an enterprising researcher noticed when they looked at the Cancer incidence so the likelihood of cancer developing in one group of diabetics versus like one group that was using Metformin versus another group that was using say Glipizide or one of the other anti-diabetic drugs they noticed that the patients who were using Metformin had a much lower likelihood of getting cancer and so then they when they looked into it they found there were multiple mechanisms through which metformin

blocked some Pathways that cancer needs to grow itself and to maintain itself so it's not by itself a cure of cancer but because it does have the ability to blunt Cancer's ability to strengthen itself or or to maintain itself it acted as a sort of soft preventative and then subsequently that drug I just mentioned Propranolol also it's been discovered to block certain cancer Pathways different cancer Pathways than me and so now there's well over 260 270 off Lael drugs that are now identified to

have minor to pretty significant cancer blocking effect the other thing that's impressive about off-label drugs is that many of the drugs have been shown to kill what's called cancer stem cells which is a very important topic because in cancer you have two sort of classes of cells you have have What's called the stem cells and then you have the daughter or the rapidly dividing cells and so usually when you go for radiation or chemotherapy or surgery to like take a tumor out most of those treatments are

used to destroy the tumor or what you can see or what you can measure the problem is less than 1% of cancer is actually What's called the stem cell which is the cell that keeps making new cancer cells and it turns out that many of these off Lael drugs metformin is one of them has been shown to kill cancer stem cells so using off Lael drugs in a array of drugs you don't use one you use many to try to block different cancer Pathways not only can shrink tumors and do reduce tumor markers but they've also

been shown to kill cancer stem cells there's a likelihood you could actually not have the cancer recur which is should be a deal breaker but unfortunately in our current medical world it's not uh and these drugs are also generally orders of magnitude safer than chemotherapies and the other treatments which many of them actually cause cancer so it's a very backwards and upside down world in the cancer World your point about icin icin you ideally since you can't give a cancer patient 30 off Lael drugs yeah you want

to Target it and supplements and there's some supplements that block these Pathways very well um you want to identify drugs and supplements that are pleotropic meaning that they don't just block one pathway like four because then if you put four off label drugs and a few supplements each of them block two to six Pathways you're blocking all sorts of ways for that cancer to feed itself and your likelihood that your overall treatment success is going to be high goes way up and one of the things

that's conspicuous about itin it's been shown to block like cancer Pathways that's no joke cumin has also been shown to block like 20 cancer Pathways so there's many of these compounds that if you add the Right Mix to a patient suffering from cancer you can predictably cut that cancer cell's energy and and ability to keep itself alive and and and help it to die out and kill the stem cells now some doctors are doing that alongside chemotherapy and radiation like using chemotherapy in

either small doses or in the regular doses but also using off Lael drugs to kill the stem cells so there's many different options out there it's a very promising Frontier in cancer and cancer treatment and probably one of the best places for people to look into it for themselves is a wonderful book called how to starve cancer it's written by a British woman by the name of Jane mcleland who used this to save her own life twice for incurable cancers
