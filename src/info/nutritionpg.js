  We are live, ladies and gentlemen. So today we have two nutritionists with us, Michelle Lucas and Lori Graham. And today's topic will all be about peptides. Lori and Michelle, introduce yourselves. >> Michelle, you can go first. >> Okay. Hi, my name is Michelle. I have a background in nutrition um and I am a health coach specializing in peptides and I'm excited to be here today. So, thanks for having me. >> Great. And I'm Lori Graham and I am a recovering occupational therapist, I

like to say. and I went back to school in menopause to work on a uh postmasters in clinical nutrition and I got certified in functional medicine and I love helping women kind of soften the blow of menopause. >> So to get started, you know, let's really start from the beginning. What even are peptides? Sure, I I can answer that. Excuse me. Um, peptides are simply just short chains of amino acids. And amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. So, you can think of them as little messengers in

the body. They tell cells what to do. Whether that's for repairing tissue, um, improving your skin, balancing hormones, or boosting metabolism. because they're naturally occurring in the body, supplementing with specific peptides can help restore functions that typically decline with age. So, I in in simple terms, I like to think of them as text messages that are are sending um messages to your body to perform functions better. >> Laura, anything to add to that? Well, I'm particularly interested in the

company um that we're involved with mostly because there's medical support and we need to stay in our lane so to say, but I find there's a lot of confusion out there for other things besides the obvious diet and exercise and even supplements. There's confusion about how to turn back the hands of time a little bit in terms of, you know, the muscle mass that goes south, maybe bone density that goes south, our sleep that goes south, um, even just our mental state sometimes. And I think that peptides have I would

say a safer profile than hormones even bioididentical hormones especially for women that are beyond 10 years after men menopause. So Michelle would you would you agree with that in your experience and in your research? I would, Lori. I would I think there there's a lot of benefits that the peptides can bring that can um you know negate some of the the side effects or the risk profiles of hormone replacement therapy. And so I would definitely agree with you. >> So for women that are aging, peptides is

a solid source. Is that correct, ladies? >> Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Is there any specific types of peptides that aging women should utilize? >> Laura, you want me to take that one? >> Yeah, definitely. Because you're more familiar with the platform at LA. >> Yeah. >> So, I would say there's probably two of them that that are the core of the the hallmarks of aging. The first being um is one of my favorites um because it helps your body produce its own natural growth hormone which tends to start to

steeply decline I believe after the age of 30 and that regulates a lot of different systems and functions in our body. [clears throat] So it can help you it can help regulate um some of your hormones. It can help you sleep better. Sleep is the hallmark of restorative um health. So it helps with that and it helps with retention of lean muscle mass which also declines with age. Um helps to keep your your muscle and your metabolism healthy. Um which also links to um you know osteoporosis and certain

diseases that decline function with um a decrease in muscle mass. So I would say the the growth hormone peptides and again Morland's my favorite. Um, and then I think the GLPS are starting to have a a real place in the longevity world. Um, outside of just, you know, what they're typically known for, weight loss. Um, I think that they they really have a place in the longevity spectrum now with regards to metabolic health and function. I mean, we have I see it every day, and Lori, I'm sure you do, too. But

we have clients that are doing everything right, but they're they're not getting results. They're not getting healthier. They're doing everything they can, and that's just because their body needs signals to help those functions work better, and that's where the GLPs can really help with metabolic health, decreasing inflammation, and that sort of thing, >> right? And you know actually my husband went on a a um a micro dose of trespatide and it was amazing to see his

blood sugar. I mean like amazing like it stayed between about 75 and 85 maybe 88 like no matter what he ate. So you know when people are doing everything right but the hemoglobin A1C goes up and you become this borderline you know insulin resistant human being but your blood sugars aren't showing that even on a CGM it's this is just one of those examples and the effects of glycation in terms of how we age in terms of we seek glycation on the genome. We seek glycation on our face. We see glycation

inside our blood vessels. It's pervasive. It's everywhere. So, you know, looking at these micro doses of, you know, the GLP1 agonists and the GIP1 agonists are pretty powerful in in terms of softening the the burden of aging or the parameters, you know, where people experience it. And everybody experiences it in different ways just because of our uniqueness, you know, our bio individuality. >> So Michelle Lori is famous as far as on this platform for saying don't guess, test. So can you explain a little bit more

about your background? You know, do you have a website for example we can share for the audience? Um, sure. Um, Lori and I both are partnered with a teleaalth company that's called LEMD. Um, and Lori, if you want to give your your site name, that would be great. >> It's Neutrify Your Life, just as it says down there underneath Decentmed Med. So you would go L emd e- l i m d at I think is >> uh it's ld.comward slash and then your >> Okay. >> Thank you. [laughter]

>> Yeah. So that that's the platform that Lori and I both partner with. And the great thing about it is that it's all run by medical professionals who specialize in peptides. So we partner with them to um educate patients about peptides and then refer them into that system and let the professionals medical professionals who specialize in those peptides take it from there to make sure that they are being um placed responsibly for the maximum benefit and safety of the patients. >> Interesting. So you guys are like third

parties between the MD and the patient. We just connect the patient to the teleaalth platform and we also help educate them um you know in that process guiding them there >> right and on the tella health pro um platform there's actually a place where you answer certain questions and one of the medical doctors or a nurse practitioner will be there's oversight to say hey you've made a good choice or no maybe you should look at something else like you're you're cleared to take

the peptide basically. >> And is your background, Michelle, completely in peptides? >> Um, no. I started out with a bachelor's of science degree in nutrition from the University of Texas and um did some nutritional counseling for a while and then went back and got my health coaching certificate from the Institute of Integrative Nutrition um where I just qualified now to sit for the boards um for the the National Health and Wellness Certification Board. So, I'll be doing that in this upcoming year, but um I

kind of took it upon myself to specialize in peptides. I've been following them for probably about the past 10 years, really paying attention to to what's been going on in the landscape and then started to experience some of the benefits myself and just thought that it was really important to educate um people and educate my clients on the benefits of peptides and not only the benefits but how they can ask access them safely and affordably. And how [clears throat] has you how have you seen that that has revolutionized

the lives of your patients? >> Oh, I mean I I can't even I could sit here all day and and talk about it, you know, from women and especially those midlife women or the, you know, perop parmenopausal women that are they're doing things right. They're trying to be healthy and they just feel like total crap and, you know, they're frustrated and then they just they come to you and they're like, I guess this is just how it's going to be. I just have to live like this. This is part of getting

older. And it's like, no, you don't have to. [gasps] This is like a rebirth, okay? And we're going to educate you and we're going to get you on the back right on the back on the right track so that you start feeling not only just like yourself, but better. You're ready to like live life for what you have left, you know? So um you know that goes all the way from losing stubborn pounds regul regulating um their blood glucose levels which again Lori mentioned how glycation affects so many things in our

bodies. Um I do have a skincare background as well. I'm an esthetician and own a spa and I see the effects of glycation on skin every day. So you know you have women that want to improve their youthfulness um metabolic function can help that too. So, it's really just to help people continue on in life with energy and zest and confidence. >> I love that, you know, especially on a personal level because one thing that Lori has told me that forever will blow my mind is that she's only had one hot

flash in 20 years. And I look at my mom, who is around Lor's age, has hot flashes all the time. So, you know, the fact that Lori has mitigated those hot flashes to the point of almost zero just tells you and especially tells women that there's so much that you can benefit from from utilizing a functional nutritionist that you can have a life that you had when you were in your 30s, now in your 50s and 60s. And Michelle, do you also work with the same age group that Lori does? women in their 50s and

60s. >> I do I would say probably starting in the you know the late 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s, even some women in into their 70s because you know they deserve to live and feel good too even even the older you are. own >> right and you know the research shows in fact if anybody watched 60 minutes this past Sunday Peter Aia was on and he's known for being one of the most forleading function I I don't want to say functional but longevity doctors and he's steeped in the science and he's an

exercise fanatic and I relate to that And you know, he said something that's really disarming and I won't buy it. [laughter] I will not buy it. But he said that no matter how much you exercise and how well you eat, everybody has a physical physiological decline at age 75 to 85 in that decide decade. And and honestly, I don't I don't want to buy into that. Why don't I want to buy into that? Is first of all, I think what we think is in part what we create. I also think that I've seen enough

evidence of people even in their 90s being very vibrant and able to move without a cane, without a walker, and just looking like I don't want to say muscular, but not looking like they have had a muscular decline. like they're they're able to keep their muscles strong. And that's one of the things that besides the cognitive, the other thing that stands out in terms of the literature is that older men and women tend to get sarcopenic, meaning their muscle mass declines. And that's because our muscles

become anabolic, meaning they're not as adept in taking on the protein that we eat. And so that's another reason why glucose goes high because if our muscles don't stay broad and larger for us, then we're not going to it's not a depository to the degree that it might have been as it was when we were younger in terms of glucose. In other words, glucose goes into the muscle to create energy. But if it if you're losing muscle, you have less of a place for that glucose to get dumped.

So, I'm all about building muscle. And I don't mean being muscle bound, but keeping our muscles strong as we age, which helps with our balance. It helps with our mobility. It helps with our blood sugar. And there's so much evidence that people are able to really stay in shape beyond that seventh and eighth decade. I don't know, Michelle, you've read the same thing and seen the same thing. >> Yeah. I mean, and we all know that, you know, the more that you can retain that

muscle, the stronger you're going to be, and the more movement you'll be able to get as you age, which is really, really important with um, you know, with everything is just being able to continue to to move uh, with strength and that keeps you keeps you young. Um, so yeah. >> Right. And and you know, I've actually seen on my and I have a high-end body composition scale, and I will say I'm 68, but on that body composition scale, because I had a big weight loss company for a while, so we had really good

scales. Um, I've seen my muscle go up about five pounds in the last three or years or so, maybe even two years. And you know, we need, and this is kind of like a side conversation. It's not the purpose, but we need to look more at our body composition and not our weight as we're aging. We want to keep our body fat lower, but we want to build our muscle. And so, you know, I've had direct evidence of diet, exercise, and just some oral peptides. I haven't even done the shots yet, you know, and I'm

definitely learning as I'm going. So, I'm excited for what they can bring to the aging process and for all of the the things that you just spoke about. I mean that's my personal stack um currently is the micro dose of trespathide and the simorin because it's helping to regulate my you know my blood glucose and increasing my metabolism and it's calmed so much inflammation in my body and when I add some to that to help with um abdominal fat reduction and aid in my sleep and help with my lean muscle mass retention

you know I have not lost muscle mass while being on a micro dose of a GLP me. Um, and I've slept, you know, again, sleep is so important. My sleep has been >> so great. I mean, I track all my biomarkers as well. They've all been optimized. My aura ring is telling me that I'm getting a lot of REM and deep sleep. So, that combination, you know, I really like um if people are, you know, clinically appropriate candidates. >> That's great. >> To that point, this question is for both

of you. What are the five most important elements of health? I know you touched on one of them being sleep, but what would be the five? >> Lori, I'll let you take that one. >> So, I go for diet first. Second place, and I think almost tied for first place is exercise. Definitely the sleep that you're talking about. And I would say personalization, you know, we are all unique. So we're we have some nuanced differences in our genome from person to person. And I'm not talking about the colors of our eyes

and things like that, but more there are what are called single nucleotide polymorphisms or they're they're lit literally morphisms in the genetic code that you might not be convert like folic acid into methyl folate which is the bioavailable form. That's the easiest example to explain. And why is that so important? It has to do with detoxification. It has to do with your heart health. Oh my goodness. You know, big time. It has to do with serotonin with your neurotransmitters. So, I believe that personalization is

another side. And I also think community, those are my five. Community is huge. >> I love that you mentioned community. yourself. >> No, I was just going to say I would absolutely agree with Lori on those five and the the one thing I would add to that is um you know the the group that we are partnered with LEMD. One of the things that I absolutely love about them is not only you know ensuring the safety and efficacy of the peptides but it's the community that LMD brings to the patients. Um that's really special. A

>> yeah, I think community is very important. When you look at the blue zones, there's only one blue zone in all the US and it's in California. And uh funny enough, she's actually on our platform and Lori introduced us, but a woman who's a five seven-day Adventist, her name's Dr. Teresa Wner and she was explaining to me one thing that sets apart that group when it comes to being in the blue zone and it's community. It's the fact that they value community. And then

when you look at Italy and Sardinia or in India, all the places that have the blue zone, the one thing they all have in common beyond diet as Lori mentioned is number one is community. You know, even when you're eating, Italian foods can be a little bit unhealthy. But when you're in community, you're eating slower, you're talking more, so you're chewing more, and you're more focused on the food. When you don't have community, especially in the States, it's rush to

finish a meal and then go watch TV or watching TV in in front, you know, as we're eating. you know, the community is lost with that. And the other thing that Lori does that I highly encourage people when it comes to exercise is she uses a vest. >> Lori, [laughter] she works out with a weighted vest. And I think that's something that's very, very important. But back to peptides, Michelle, what are copper peptides? >> Sure. So, copper peptides, they're a special type of peptide that is bound

with mineral copper, and they're known for their regenerative effects, especially in the skin and soft tissue. Um, copper peptide supports collagen production. It reduces inflammation and accelerates healing. So, it's great post um postsurgery for that soft tissue healing. And in functional medicine and skin care, it's popular for promoting youthful uh skin, very important for that. and um overall just has a great role in cellular repair. >> Anything to add to that, Lori? >> No, I think that's right on.

And you can take it as a cream. [laughter] >> Absolutely. [snorts] >> And Michelle, do you utilize copper peptides uh in your everyday life? >> I do. I have a it's actually LMD's topical formulation that has a bunch of powerhouse skincare ingredients in it and copper is one of them. So, I do I do use their product that contains copper and I've seen great results not only in myself but my clients, you know, at my spa and um but I am itching to try the injectable copper. That's going to be

next on my anti-aging list because I've seen such um amazing before and after results of people um you know with wrinkles and stretch marks. And I've also heard some amazing testimonials about recovery after surgery, which hopefully I'm not going to have anytime soon. But just the the overall um you know benefit of copper in itself, I I'm excited to try the injectable form of it as well. >> Interesting. So you touched on it briefly, but I'd like for both of you to really expand on it. How does functional

nutrition play a role in peptides and how does it buffer the success that you guys have had with your patients? >> So, I'm going to speak to the part with because I haven't worked with my p I'm I'm new in this company and I'm new to I'm newer to this experience, but I have heard and I I think there's a correlation here that If you've optimized your diet, then you can layer in some of the other things like you can personalize nutrition and you can personalize your

peptides and and the list goes on. But I think, and correct me if I'm wrong, Michelle, but I think I'm right when I say this, that if you're still eating a lot of processed foods, and I'm not saying you have to be 100% perfect, but if you're still eating a lot of, you know, processed foods, I think that the peptides will not be able to work their magic as well as if you have optimized your diet. Yeah, Lori, I I completely agree with you. In fact, I see peptides and functional nutrition really as partners.

Nutrition really provides the raw materials, the vitamins, the minerals, the antioxidants that help the body run efficiently. And the peptides are like the targeted instructions that help optimize these processes. So, when combined, you're addressing both the fuel and the messaging system, which which creates a more complete approach to health. And so I I really do consider them partners. And it c it can't be one single magic bullet. It's definitely a partnership of the two. And a perfect

example of that is where you have people who are doing everything right. They're eating right. They're exercising. They're sleeping. And and they still don't feel well. And there's reasons for that. And so if they're giving their body the fuel it needs, but the messenger systems aren't working. So when you combine the two, that's where you get like the big win. Um, so you know, if you're eating a lot of processed foods and sugary foods, and again, it doesn't have to be 100% of the

time, but if you're doing all those things right and not helping to optimize your body, you're not going to see um, you know, an optimal result from peptides. So, it's really, you know, a combination of the two. And that's where professionals like Lori and I step in to to to help with that. >> And that's where the coaching plays a role. Correct. So, how does that coaching element, Michelle, play a role with the peptides and the diet and lifestyle? >> That's a great question and I know we

you were just talking before about the importance of community. I think having support on this journey is very important. Um, there's a lot of misinformation out there. So being able to be guided towards the right information and helping with uh you know a positive mindset through the process and a little accountability is always a good thing. And I think when you marry all those things together you really get a good synergy. >> Lori, do you have anything to add to that? Well, actually, yeah. And, you

know, I go back to the thought that we, you know, there are a lot of women that do the whole diet and lifestyle thing pretty well. They're in the gym and they're exercising, but starting at about age 30 to 40 in that, you know, decade, we start to decline in our peptide production. And you know, if I trace back, I mean, in some ways, I feel better than I ever felt. But I remember I remember a dip. Do you know what I mean? And and I've dialed in for that reason, for that dip. But if I had

access to peptides in pmenopause, maybe I would have been sleeping better back then. You know what I mean? Absolutely. >> Yeah, >> that's why I think it's so important to, you know, educate and create awareness around this so that, you know, it's not just a certain subset of the population that has access to these kinds of things. And that's really the kind of movement that we're trying to create at LMD is to really, you know, empower people to be more proactive about their

health and know um, you know, what's accessible to them to help them improve their quality of life and restore their um, you know, functions optimally. So >> yeah, education is definitely everything. If you don't have that proper education, then you cannot make an informed decision, >> right? So, how do you guys help to educate your patients? I know that things like this do a great job at educating the patient that we have expertise in peptide, so you should trust us. But how do you educate your

patients? I'll start with Lori. Well, you know, I just last night had an AMA and I've been posting a little bit about peptides and it was a great opportunity because the questions were there about peptides and people are looking for answers outside of painkillers, anti-inflammatories. you know, people who are older don't always experience the best measure of health. And it's it's I'm surprised at how open a few of my patients who came to my group meeting were with regards to

peptides. So, that's been my experience. How about you, Michelle? >> Yeah, I mean, I'm Lori, I love your social media, by the way. you you do some great um you know education on your social media platforms. So, thank you for that. I always enjoy them. Um [clears throat] you know, I'm pretty active on social as well as and so you know, I send occasional emails out. A lot of it is about the one-on-one education that I have with clients, you know, so it's personalized. We talk

about that personalized medicine being the future and how important personalization is. So, it's a lot of one-on-one education. The other thing that I really love, I'll give another shout out to LMD, is that they have um a YouTube channel that has a ton of recordings of all of their educational series, which they conduct an educational series with a health and wellness uh provider or physicians every single week on new content. And that really helps me to help keep my uh my audience educated by having fresh

something fresh, a new fresh topic every week. Oh, that's great. Yeah. >> Yeah, it definitely is. Especially giving more information. And everyone definitely give a follow to Lori at Lori Graham 1156 on Instagram. Lori post every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. So, back to peptides. So when you look at peptides, we spoke about how peptides can really help with lowering your blood sugar as well as menopause, but let's move to the brain. So how does peptides play a role in brain health?

>> Yeah, that that's a great question and I think that's where there is a lot of excitement um in the future of peptides is with, you know, being able to restore and preserve cognitive function. And I think a lot of that has to do with the anti-inflammatory benefits of many of these peptides. So certain peptides support neurotransmitter balance, blood flow, um, and even neurons from oxidative stress. For example, peptides can help with focus, memory, um, and resilience to stress. And as we all

know, brain health is central to everything. Um, energy, mood, sleep, productivity. So supporting it with the right peptides can really be life-changing. And that, you know, that's kind of a topic that's near and dear to me. My dad has, um, you know, dementia and was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. And so, I've really taken kind of a a vested interest in continuing to follow all the benefits that, um, you know, that the peptides have as far as brain health and um, you know, helping him as much as I can.

you know in terms of brain health also we now look at you know dementia and Alzheimer's as another mechanism is blood sugar and so if we can micro dose with some of the GLP1 agonists that would technically take that burden off the brain and improve circulation so you know that's the other class of peptides in there you actually that can help with cognitive function, >> right? >> And speaking of peptides for brain health. So I just pulled up a study and this is impact of peptide transport

and memory function in the brain uh by PBM Med published by four authors and recent studies have reported the benefits of food derived peptides for memory dysfunction. Beyond the physiological effects of peptides, their bioavailability to the brain still remains unclear since the blood brain barrier strictly controls the transportation of compounds to the brain. Additionally, the mechanisms of action of brain health peptides in relation to the pathogenesis of neurodeenerative diseases particularly Alzheimer's

disease are discussed. So, can you ladies speak a little bit about this study um and your work with peptides or what you've seen with peptides related to Alzheimer's disease? >> I haven't seen Have you Have you Michelle? >> Um I have not seen that particular um article. However, as I said, because of my um you know, family history, I have paid attention to a lot of the publications that have been coming out and the research. And I think a lot of it, you know, we don't have hard

concrete evidence of some of this yet. Um, but I think that it's all being studied very closely and it all looks very, very promising from what I've read. Um, and that's really all I can speak to at the moment. >> Yeah, I just found another study. This is peptide family promotes brain cell rejuvenate rejuvenation and improved cognition through peripheral delivery by ACS publications. So peptides definitely have seen an improvement uh this is according to aged mice seeing an improved cognitive

function in age mice. So there's definitely a lot of success here or at least potential success here for utilizing peptides for brain health. But speaking on menopause, since both of you work with menopause and utilize peptides for menopause, how have you seen that have success in your work? >> Again, Michelle, you go first because you've had more experience than me. >> Okay. Yeah, that's you know I've had a lot of experience with that with um pmenopause and menopausal clients and

peptides have just you know being a but given them their their life back honestly and their confidence and it's women showing up to you every day saying like I don't like the way I feel. I don't feel like myself. I can't believe this is how I just have to live the rest of my life. My joints ache. I keep gaining weight no matter how much I exercise or eat clean. I have brain fog. my hormones are all out of balance. You know, you have people that really are trying to live a healthy life in this

stage of their life and there's just something that's not firing correctly in their body. And that's when we have the opportunity to introduce peptides to to help and um partner with all of the great things that they're trying to do to improve their health so that they can actually feel like themselves again and maybe even feel better than they did before they hit this phase of life. You know, like Lori had mentioned, um you know, feeling like you were back in your your late 20s and 30s. is just really

able to help with um you know all of the inflammation that come we call it inflammaging um all of the inflammation that comes with aging. And a lot of people don't realize all of the effects systemically on the body that all of that chronic inflammation has. And it doesn't necessarily meaning that you're doing something wrong. I think a lot of people will admit that they still have room to make some lifestyle changes, you know, to help themselves out. But when you're helping them with peptides,

giving them another tool to um help all these processes message correctly in the body, you can really really help a woman and and men, you know, in this midlife um again not only feel like themselves but feel better than they did before. >> Right. >> Right. >> Yeah. as you both spoke on. Oh, Lori, >> I know I was going to say I have um done only because I I'm new to LEMD, but I was with another company that was really marketing strongly and I met somebody at the gym. So, I played around with some

of the buckle delivery and I find I sleep better on those nights. I capture more deep sleep and you know like I'm able to do everything I've ever done before. My speed is a little less like let's say riding my bicycle or running or in the pool but not a lot less. But the one thing that's been a problem for me through menopause, not the hot flashes, but the sleep, the interrupted sleep. And I've seen that improve. And you know that's just like wow you know because that is a huge piece of cognitive

function as we age you know >> and I'll add too it's you know you have anecdotal reports of um you know patients saying that they feel better and you know and it's great but really the proof is in the pudding when you look at things like you know aura ring readings where you look at your stages of sleep and you look at your biioarkers to see where your A1C is and your cholesterol. And so when you track all those things, I mean, that's that's really showing like it's it's not just

in this person's mind. This is actually making physiological changes in the body for cellular renewal. And it's pretty amazing when you look at um on how all of it improves, >> right? Well, and as Lori mentioned earlier, as women venture into menopause, they start to see a decrease in bone density. And this study, according to UCLA Health, mentions that collagen peptides may be beneficial for menopausal bone loss. So, with that being said, this question is for Lori. So, Lori, you were doing work

in the diabetes space. You started out as an occupational therapist. Now you're moving into the longevity world. So what ventured you into working with peptides? Um years ago, maybe about five years ago, a naturopath introduced me to BPC157. And I was very taken that it was a peptide beyond collagen peptides because collagen peptides have been around, you know, for a long time. and the benefits of that throughout the gastrointestinal system and then you know if you take it you know as a shot then believe it or not you get that

anti-inflammatory benefit throughout your system. So to me that that was my first entrance with more recently like in the last year was when I started saying I need to keep my ear a little closer to the ground for my patients. But I always had this I want to say pushpull in the sense that I'm not a medical doctor. I don't want to lose my license. I don't want to harm anybody. all those things. So that's why LMD is so perfect to me that I don't h I don't have to take the medical responsibility. I'm just saying

here's a different way to kind of like knit the yarn, you know, like like it's just it's just a different way to handle your health that might be less problematic than doing hormone replacement, especially when you're 10 years out where the research gets a little murky regarding safety. or a little conflicting. I think there's conflicting data, you know. So, >> and to Lor's point about the conflicting data, that's why we made decent med and Michelle I'll explain, you know, uh, off

camera a little bit more, but one reason why we did was because there isn't enough information out there coming from providers. There's a lot of information coming from MDs, but there isn't enough information coming from nutritionist and holistic providers. And there needs to be because number one, people are going to do these things regardless. Whether it's peptides, whether it's psychedelics, whether it's alternative cancer treatments, whatever it is, they're going to do it regardless. So,

giving them informed information can help them to make the best decision possible. And that's why shows like this are important because before someone does peptides, understanding from Michelle and Lori who are nutritionists, who are health coaches, who operate in this space, it can help you to make an informed decision. Because even though today we pulled up four different sources about the benefits of peptides, learning that information from the two of you is far more impactful than reading a

multiplicity of studies. >> Especially for the lay person. >> Yeah. >> You know, it's it's I mean, I've pulled up studies and you know, somewhere midstudy I go to the end to find out the summary. Like I'm not a scientist. I certainly know how to read a study, but the lay person is is going to do better listening to a a professional who can give them the time. That's the other thing. Traditional medicine nowadays um you know is a 15minute visit that you have with your doctor and rare

are the doctors that even now buy into bioididentical hormones or peptides. You know they're just not you know they're not there and nobody can afford to give you the time. But when a nutritionist works with a patient, they're working with them 45 minutes to an hour to an hour and a half. I mean, there's a lot of relationship. Like, I think we know patients more deeply in our model of delivering care. I think we get to know our patients more deeply than some doctors do. Yeah, I would agree. And and the one

thing that I would add um you know with what Lori is doing is is she's not just able to educate, she's able to provide um accessibility as well. And I think that's really important because there's so many black market unsafe peptides and even vitamin supplements, you know, out there. But particularly when it comes to peptides, you have people that are getting them from um unverified sources, maybe overseas, they're they're constituting them themselves from powder. I mean, there's a lot of unsafe

things going on out there. And with the platform that she's using, she can give her patients access to safe and um affordable options. And I think that's important to highlight too is to be able to guide people, educate them, and guide them to safe sources. >> 100% 100%. Helping people to be informed consumers is everything. And that's what I love that both of you guys do. So this question is again for Lori because we know Michelle, your work has been a lot more in the peptide world. Lori has

ventured into the longevity space. So Lori, how have you seen peptides be beneficial or correlate with longevity? >> I, you know, again, I'm new to this space, but I've seen a few people at Lifetime Gym that look pretty damn good for being in their 60s. Um, I just have observed I've observed people in my environment thriving with them. They they are not my patients. But I will tell you, I've seen a couple of blood tests of these people, and to your point, Michelle, when you were

talking about cholesterol and blood sugar, like everything was in the right right place, which is what really caused me to be so open, you know, to peptides. And because I I always say my patient population has aged with me. So, you know, if that's my population, then I need to be providing this. So, you know, I I still have to learn, Sam. I'm very humble about this. You know, I but I'm grateful that I can say, "Please look at this. These are a couple of things that you struggle with. These are a couple of

peptides you might want to look at." you know, and I like that there's physician super, you know, supervision. I think I think I will never know what a doctor knows, you know. So, I I I have to stay humble in this. So with that being said, I want to re read conclusions from another study I found regarding dietary peptides and their correlation to aging and have both of you guys give your perspective on the study. So here are the conclusions. This was a study by sciencedirect.com dietary peptides and aging evidence and

prospects. There are emerging reports demonstrating that multiple food derived peptides have potent anti-aging mechanisms. Bioactive peptides modulate pathways involved aging, particularly those associated with metabolism and nutri nutrient sensing. Multifunctional bioactive peptide from soy peptides SRB P-2 target P CK9 protein and lowered LR levels possibly mediated by elevated SR EBP2 and hindered the P CK9-LDR interaction. Bioactive peptides also modulate glucose metabolism as you ladies mentioned earlier improving glute

4 transllocation and mimic the FDA approved LDL lowering drugs. Additionally, food peptides also improve insulin resistance as Lori mentioned of C57Bl 6J towards the improvement of overall health status. From the available evidence, a single bioactive peptide can exhibit both metabolic and mitochondrial improvement effects by targeting multiple pathways and effective reducing endogenous oxidative stress. Besides, multiple peptides have been identified for modulization or modulation of nutrient sensing pathways and target vital aging

pathways such as MTOR, amknuins or s i tu i ns. Yet there is still a significant gap in knowledge about the structure function relationship of bioactive peptides. As Michelle mentioned, furthermore, most of pharmarmacologically active bioactive peptides obtained from food sources remain unexplored for their ability to extend lifespan. There is prospective opportunity in exploring further as some of the peptides may have exhibited therapeutic effects by influencing the mtor and which play an important role in

regulating lifespan. So to elucidate for anybody who's a more of a lay person listening to that when when they talk about nutrient sensing pathways and mTor that's what they're talking about. So that's just saying your body senses when you're fasting through through nutrient sensing fast uh pathways or when you're eating. And obviously with certain peptides you're increasing growth hormone. So that's also increasing mTor. So the the downside would be taking it for a long long long long period of time

without breaks possibly. But all the recommendations that are on the site talk about taking it for two months, one month off, or 5 days and two days off. There's all sorts of configurations so that you are not in a progrowth mode for an extended period of time. That's number one. Even when we take a protein shake though, we're stimulating those nutrient sensing pathways or mTor and the stimulation to progrowth only lasts a couple of hours. So the concern and Michelle correct me or add to this.

The concern would be if you didn't take a break maybe in terms of progrowth and cancer. Yeah. No, I agree. And I think that just emphasizes the importance of being guided by u medical professionals that specialize in in these molecules um to make sure that you know you're doing everything safely and in optimizing your health the correct way. >> Right. And the other thing that I picked up on that, Sam, they talked about PSK9s and those are drugs that are used to lower cholesterol. And I find it really

interesting that that study talks about that pathway which corroborates with seeing modulation or moderation of cholesterol levels especially as people age. And Michelle, you can certainly speak to that as well. Yeah, I mean I think you answered that that question beautifully. >> Thank you. And that's something, by the way, that Lori has been working on and has touched on when it comes to cholesterol because that's one thing that I think the mainstream health organizations and really just mainstream health in general

has gotten wrong about cholesterol and has really been cholesterol, cholesterol, cholesterol, but hasn't focused on some of the exterior factors. So, I think we've touched on this, but I will ask briefly, uh, this one can go to you, Michelle. How does peptides help with weight loss? >> Sure. So, I think that goes back to um optimizing, you know, metabolic function >> um and really increasing lean muscle mass and decreasing um oh my gosh, I'm at a loss for words right now. Um

visceral visceral fat. So, so these all play a role, you know, in how healthy your metabolism is. Um, and I think the products like the GLPS and again like the the growth hormone peptides like Samorin all aid and work together to help just bring a met metabolic um optimization and synergy in your body that helps to, you know, decrease stubborn weight, decrease that visceral fat, decrease subcutaneous fat, um, you know, help to have a good um, lean muscle mass ratio. I think they just do a really great job of optimizing

all those functions in the body. >> Definitely. And do you have any studies um regarding peptides and fat loss? >> Um there there are a ton a ton. I can't uh like really rattle them off off the top of my brain, but if you go to Lor's LEMD website and click on some of the different peptides, at the bottom of the page, you'll actually see scientific sources that are um you know, scientific published articles that um relate to each of the specific peptides for someone that's wanting to dive a little

deeper. But there's a there's a lot out there and there's going to be a lot more to come. >> Yes. >> Is this the correct link that I just posted? >> I don't see any uh Yes. >> Okay. So, yeah, if you guys want to check that out, I do look there is one right here. Shannon M glp-1 plus B12. I joined LMD and people were asking me all the time how I lost the weight. Why I wouldn't tell everyone the best thing I ever did to lose weight. I believe it so much and I'm a nurse. I

tell everyone. So, >> right. And and like most patients go to their doctors and get peptides, but I love the combination with NAD for energy. Oh my god. And B12 for energy. Like that's just a brilliant idea in my mind to combine them, you know. So, especially if you're eating less and perhaps not getting the energy from your food that you need to be getting during that time to support with that, you know. And on another note, NAD goes down as we age. It's like a longevity supplement. Um, [laughter]

and you know, we make less NAD as we age. I mean, starting at about age 40. So, here's another, you know, there are so many things that decline and we do need to pick up the slack if we want to really age and function well. So, I love that they put that in with the peptide. I love it. And one thing that sticks with me that both of you guys touched on is that you need both. As my mom always says, it's and and both. You need the lifestyle and diet and the peptides. You need them to work in correlation with one another

because as Michelle mentioned, the peptide is essentially like the the the navigator, I think is how you you said it correct. >> Yeah. It's like sending text messages back and forth. >> 100%. And that's very, very important. So, my final question for you both is how do you utilize wellness in your everyday lives? And we'll start with you, Michelle. >> That's a great question. So, I do try to um practice what I preach. So, I I focus on balance a lot, not perfection.

Um uh for me that means eating a nutrient-dense diet to get, you know, good sources of whole clean um you know, foods for the vitam vitamins and minerals, getting movement every day. It doesn't have to be going and running a marathon. It can be, you know, just simply getting up and and walking and getting some steps in that way. Good sleep hygiene. I really try to focus as especially the older I get on getting into a routine that helps with um good sleep, making sure the room is dark, not doing anything um you know in bed other

than sleeping um all of those things because I really think sleep is is a huge component of a healthy lifestyle. Um, I also try to do practices for stress management, try to practice mindfulness. And I think as health coaches, that's one thing that we can really help with too is helping to people people be more mindful um, and present. And I think that really helps a lot. I also use supportive tools like peptides and biohacking strategies to optimize my energy and recovery. And, you know, most importantly, I really

listen to my body and adjust based on what it needs. instead of chasing a one-sizefits-all, you know, I listen to my body and I make adjustments as needed and I I try to help others do the same. >> What about you, Lori? >> Well, I very deeply um agree that we have to listen to our own bodies. And you know, I noticed years ago when I started exercising [snorts] towards the end of college, like really exercising regularly, that a lot of things felt better. And also, I was much more focused. I I got the serotonin piece of

this, like, you know, just get the job done that I needed to get done, and I've maintained that. But the thing that I've always done that I think makes a difference is, you know, I went from running marathons to doing triathlons. So the thing I've kept is crossraining. And I think at my age, the fact that I don't get injured is huge, is really huge. So I like to do something every single day. It could be an intense yoga class. It could be, you know, going for a short run walk. It could be going for

a swim. Um, I do play tennis when the weather is nice because I don't like playing indoors. And and I eat plantforward, nutrient-dense, so very plantforward. Um, I support with I do support with protein powders because I don't eat higher in the food chain. And I I also dial in on my sleep and I spend some time in nature every day. We walk our dog in the local woods and that's a wonderful time. So yeah, we we have to do the best we can because how is anybody going to believe us? Like when you go to the

doctor who's overweight and has a cigarette, you know, pack of cigarettes on the counter, how do you trust them? [laughter] So, thank you for your time today.
