    start with introduce yourself I'm Stacy theodon and I started my journey with ayurveda actually I will take it way way back more than 30 years ago when I had my own chronic health problems and because of that I you know I spent I I call it the medical Mambo I went from Doctor to doctor place to place trying to figure out like what was wrong you know how to cure what was wrong with me I got all lowed to runaround you know at one point I I had uterine fibroid tumors and I was quite young and I had bleeding

I bled every single day for two years so of course after all that bleeding I became very anemic I needed blood transfusions and I was told early on that well all the interventions involved you know radical drugs or surgeries that would leave scarring in the uterine area or even I was recommended at one point to have a hysterectomy and that if I did that I'd stop bleeding and I said that's a lot like me saying I have a migraine and you say decapitate yourself like your life will be forever Changed by

removing organs right and I kept saying but why am I bleeding why am I having this problem right because I'd been pretty healthy up until then after going place to place for a couple of years and I just kept feeling worse and worse and worse and I I I had that innate knowing that there's got to be some better way to handle this as a young person I've got to be able to heal and still be able to have the choice whether or not to have children later on and that choice will be completely removed if I have a

hysterctomy and yeah my pain will go away and I'll stop bleeding but why was I bleeding in the first place how did I get to be this way I ended up going to Nevada to see an ayurvedic doctor Dr Krueger it just changed my life dramatically the very first session he had asked me to come out there and he wanted to see me every day for a week and it was really interesting to me because I of course told him what my problem was ah Hadad of time on the phone and this is way before video calls and all that when I got to his office he

had a whole wall of pictures of babies and those were all babies that were born after the mothers were told that they wouldn't be able to have children so I thought that was you know inspiring and again I was a young person I didn't necessarily want to have kids right then but I wanted to have the choice later on the very first time that I saw him he did some Hands-On treatments my pain stopped by later that day and by the next morning I wasn't bleeding anymore so pretty much whatever he told me to do

after that I was going to listen it's when I learned about ayurveda and how to care for myself with ayurvedic medicine I healed from those particular issues that I had at the time eventually I had the opportunity to study ayurvedic medicine and I don't think I initially wanted to do it for a living I was just really like wanted to wrap my head around like what is all this and why does it work you know and the deeper I went into it the more I was interested in being able to share my experience

educate people as well that's how I got into ayurveda initially I've been in private practice for over 25 years and for the last 25 years I have been working at carmano Cancer Treatment Centers here in the Detroit area teaching ayurvedic practices energy healing meditation and all of those kind of things that are part of ayurveda you know the energy work seasonal nutrition and being in harmony with nature started with the ayurveda and being in that field of course everybody anything that

was natural holistic and so on people would say do you know about this do you know about that and that's how I ended up getting into studying energy healing modalities from around the world so I studied Chiang which is from China of course I studied Prana which and chakra balancing which is part of ayurveda and then I learned raiki and kruna Kei which come from Japan so we every place every corner of the world has a way of talking about energy so everything is really energetic and so I studied energy

healing in depth and over the years I've just continued to add to my offerings you know and as I've explored ways to provide my own healing and trained on how to do that then I continue to share and grow the offerings that I have for clients to learn how to care for themselves in a more holistic approach since 2020 this decade has really been all about losing trust in traditional whether it's traditional media traditional medicine traditional and I'm glad that you mentioned you work with

cancer I want to get your reaction to this video video can take away all my physical abilities it cannot touch my mind it cannot touch my heart and it cannot touch my soul and those three things are going to carry on forever affects everyone it's the one thing that whether you're rich poor gay or straight white black doesn't matter it's unavoidable we yet to have a cure millions of dollars spent on Healthcare advanced technology and traditional medicine yet we have no cure it's big business right so even

though we have healthful products on the market that cause cancer or are contributing factors to cancer it's big business to keep them where they are on the shelves and having people continue to buy them and then invest in Medical Treatments you know traditional medicine and really the reason why I created the project so since 2020 this decade has really been all about losing trust in traditional you know this massive distrust in traditional medicine and that was why I created this Coalition

and why I created this platform in the beginning I wanted it to really change the landscape of healthcare why did you join the Coalition and I told you my goals for what I want this to be but what is your goal well Samuel I really was drawn to your vision of how you can can help people with this type of platform so that's what drew me to want to join the Coalition I'm very passionate about what I do and my ability to help people educate them on how to better care for themselves and I thought this was an

excellent platform that you are creating and I want to be a change maker and so um I thought getting on the ground floor of where I see some positive benefit you know for people moving forward and how they can more affordably and easily access the kind of information that they might like and they don't know where to go I like the centralized you know location of what you're doing it's not even about interest in ayurveda it's the fact that people don't even know what it is last night you know when people asked

me what I do and I say ayurveda it's like first of all well what is that right and I'll answer what that is it means the science or wisdom of life it's a Sanskrit word that means a science or wisdom of life and is the oldest most complete holistic medical system in the world coming from India and it's been in continual use for over 5,000 years and even though it's been around for super long time it's especially here in the US I can only compare because I live here it's you know people don't know what it

is when I connect with the people in India even if they're not using those practices they all know what it is it's funny because the only really that people know about it is you know Aaron roders the quarterback of the Green Bay Packers talking about Ponch Sharma and talking about how he went on a retreat you know on iasa Retreat and everyone pretty much clowned him for it so what they do is they they clowned ayurveda itself just because Aaron Rogers did it when really the thing that people should

look at is the fact that he's one of the oldest quarterbacks in the NFL and he's still playing because he's doing these alternative medicine treatments and it's the same thing you've seen with Tom Brady introducing more of a vegan diet LeBron James introducing more vegan elements into what he does you know you're you're seeing these athletes play longer than everyone else and everyone's like why is that you know why is it that Tom Brady can beat time and how is it

LeBron can do this and blah blah blah and the reality is it's because they use alternative medicine Circle back you know I mentioned that benefit of How It's helped the athletes oh there's so many ways that iured it can help the average person because the average person their adrenals are on fire they're super stressed out all the time pinched for time they they eat on the run you know they're not preparing their own food now in ayura we don't necessarily and a vegan diet can be very

health supporting as well as a pescatarian and so on but again it goes back to the quality of the food and in ayurveda it's not necessary for everybody to be a vegan so if that doesn't suit that person and their you know how they feel about things but I will say that having more plant-based Foods is helpful but ayurveda helps people more discipline and more balance in their in their daily lives the trilogy of Body Mind Spirit comes from ayurveda so if you visualize a three-legged stool if you have a

three-legged stool you can stand on it it's a good foundation for anything but if you remove one leg two legs won't won't hold it up right it's going to tip over so if your body is off if your mental thinking is off or your spiritual self is off you're not going to be in balance and Harmony so I people tell me all the time oh gosh how many different ways it helps them their lives at work become better their relationships become better how they feel becomes better the way they parent if their parents that

becomes better the way that they have relationships with others becomes better because they are working on their primary relationship which is you know your your dance partner for life you yourself right they just feel more in harmony they learn to be more patient um they learn to use their own intuition kind of like how I did as a young person like having that knowing there's got to be a better way than just cutting out body parts when you're in your early 20s right and then say well you're you're

all good now that didn't seem like a good thing to me so I think it opens up choices for people when you feel good mentally physically emotionally spiritually going through life is is better that's why it makes everything better right you have more energy for all of the parts of life I can't tell you enough how it impacts people people and how they come back to me and they're like you know they came to me for a particular problem and maybe it was cancer maybe it was diabetes maybe it

was some other chronic thing Ms you know uh fibromyalgia all kinds of different things but when you have chronic pain you're not in your your best light you don't feel your best and all your interactions are impacted by that you know all the relationships improve like I said whether it's work at home or whatever because they're feeling better you know when you get rid of chronic pain and chronic inflammation it opens up your mental capacity so you can just do more in life you know and they're

learning like I said before holistic medicine is simple it's simple things right but it's not easy because it takes discipline you know and when people learn that discipline it's like and they carve out that time for themselves they they crave it they crave to have those practices whether that be breathing meditation gratit practices preparing their own Foods you know you enjoy your food more I think too when you're not eating out of a box in a hurry all the time people are distracted they're on phones devices

watching TV doing social media and all these other things instead of being present and that's a lot of the mindfulness parts of uh ayurveda and meditation is that you learn to be like in the moment and all anxiety is created by you're either looking forward to the future to something that has yet to occur or you're ruminating on something that already happened that you can't change all you can do if you've had a past experience that didn't suit you well is take that wisdom and move

forward and and choose differently in the present moment and learn to honor where where you're at you know there is no oniz fits-all ayurvedic diet but I will say that we are eating seasonal nutrition so it's eating things that are in season that are from your part of the world instead of you know if I'm here in Detroit and it's the middle of winter um bananas aren't on the menu we don't live in a tropical climate right um so that's that's one aspect of it all the food

choices are related to our Dosha and our Dosha imbalances so your Dosha is your they're based on the elements so we are all have a little bit of each of the doas so there's Vata we're in Vata season right now Vata means wind or air and that's the winter season it's the longest season in ayurveda it begins November 1 and it goes through the spring when we move into kafa season kafa means water so that's the spring element and then we have Patia which means fire and that correlates with the

um season of summer when it would be warmer and hotter um so each of us have elements of all the above most people are not trosa we're not equally balanced in all of them lot of people um most people have two pred predominant doas or one predominant Dosha and so you have your proerty which is your nature like how you were born so certain parts of like determining your Dosha have to do with eye and hair color the type of skin texture that you have and your skeletal build and all those kind how muscular

you are and all those things which cannot be changed right those are that's how you're born and then other things are come into it from you know things that were introducing into our our energetic space so that could be the foods that we're eating the things that we're putting on our skin the thoughts in our head even the kind of music we're listening to like how active we are all those kind of things affect our doas and therefore doshic imbalances so when I work with a client we determine their

Dosha that's pretty pretty quick off so that we know both their nature and where there might be an imbalance so certain imbalances translate into certain disease states in the body you know over and over and over again yeah so um people who have a lot of joint pain for example that would is typically a Vata imbalance right that's something that we have in the colder season so people tend to be achier and vat seasoning also relates to like later life years where people would have more of those kind of

issues and then what we do is the foods that we recommend of course are always going to be in season but then they are specific to that Dosha some doshas should never eat red meat some doshas do very well with it you know um poultry you know may or may not be indicated uh you know Seafood may or may not be indicated but we all do better when we have at least a large proportion of our nutrition come from plant-based items you know because uh fruits and vegetables can be very supportive and and again we're using things that are

the more we can eat locally and the more we can eat in seasoned Foods you know so in fall and winter we have a little bit different foods you know that we would have then versus the summertime even by where you live in the world those are more supportive and the the fresher you can eat food and I had talked about energy before yeah food can have a vibration just like people vibrate all living things vibrate so the closer you eat your food to when it was picked the more nutrients you get or the higher

vibration the food is if you take food that's in a can wow well now it has no vibration so it will give you calories it will keep you alive but it won't actually add to that vibration or raise that vibration to make you in better health so um that's one of the reasons that we eat such fresh food you obviously have done work with cancer patients notice the issue of imbalance right a lot of diseases whether it's the metab imbalance in your metabolism or imbalance in your hormones so I found it

really interesting that like you mentioned it's every single disease stems from an imbalance and even trying to fit a glove of eight you know or billions of people to eat a certain diet just doesn't work because everyone's different so I like that you mentioned that ayurveda doesn't have a specific diet if I am you know in the Inuit tribe for instance I'm not going to be able to eat a vegan diet because I can't find the plants I'm going to have to hunt my food whenever I want to eat and you

would find that those things would support that culture do you know what I'm saying so um we're we're drawn to the things that are readily available so even like the herbs that naturally grow in your yard and what kind of vegetables naturally grow here my region versus somebody else's region I would say in an overall sense you're you're more acclimated to eat those things but how does this like affect cancer patients like when I'm at the hospital working and I see what snacks people bring in

with them I see lots of juice I see lots of bottled protein drinks that are high in sugar I see them eating lots of snack foods and packaged foods and that's exactly how they got into the state that they're in right now those will provide them calories and keep them alive but it's definitely not adding to their vibration and certainly won't heal them so when we introduce you know Fresh Foods and herbs and and spices and things like that our health supporting it absolutely changes how we feel you

know on every level that's the biggest I think one of the biggest things is habits and food food intake what people are putting into their bodies that affect their disease State and how they're feeling but again we're looking to your particular Dosha so some doas there's there's six tastes in ayurveda we all are you know have have all the tastes in our diet so you have like astringent sweet salty bitter you know all those kind of things where we get those tastes from would vary by our DOA

you know so some some doas do well with honey some do better with agave you know what I'm saying for like a sweet fruits are okay but again certain fruits are more supportive of of certain doas versus other doas so that's where kind of some of that education comes in where I'm telling people lean into these things they're more supportive of your Dosha or your Dosha imbalances and lean away from these things so even though like Millet or a particular kind of nut like you might have heard someplace that

it's good it might be less supportive than a different nut for your DOA or your Dosha imbalance it it's there's no one size fits all well even like um you're talking about a vegan diet or even vegetarian diet some people eat cheese pizza and they think they're a vegetarian right yeah or they're eating you know pasta and they say it's vegan you know if it's made without egg or something is that the most supportive vegan food that you can find probably not right nuts nuts grains seeds fruits

and vegetables are going to be more supportive than a packaged thing that just lacks Animal product you know what I'm saying an animal product isn't bad because if you're a vegan then it's necessary a lot of times to supplement with the B vitamins and such because you don't get get them naturally from the foods that you're consuming some people are supported by eating eggs and dairy and and other things that would be part of more vegetarian way of eating some people need you know that do very well

with the pescatarian or with um poultry and so on I think we can agree for like anybody that red meat's got more saturated fat so if that's an issue for you then you might want to stay away from it but it ayurveda doesn't specifically say that the whole world needs to be vegan or vegetarian but it certainly is a supportive way to eat once you know which food items um are best and most supportive for your particular doop in the fighting world two fighters both were vegan Nate Diaz was vegan and his career started to take

a downward file and or sugar Shan om Ali who actually recently just became a champion he went the opposite route and went from vegan to starting to eat meat and because of that I don't know if there's a direct correl there but he started to win and actually became a champion great point that you know just thinking that it's a one-size fo all instead of looking at the individual looking at your lifestyle looking at your environment and looking at your Dosha really plays a pivotal role in

your diet well the traditional Health Care System the way that I see it and working in a hospital environment all of these years is that people want quick and easy solutions people don't want want to have to put a lot of time and energy into taking care of themselves and um if you go to somebody and they tell you do this this and this and pop this pill and you do that that's pretty easy peasy right but if you are really going to take care of yourself in a holistic sense and use um something like

ayurveda or another natural um modality to support yourself it actually involves you tuning into your intuition and it takes a lot of daily practices right so like I said ayurveda and natural medicine are simple but not easy right because it actually takes daily discipline I practice yoga meditation gratitude practices prepare my own food and so on every single day right every day so that takes effort and a lot of people don't want to put that much time and energy into caring for themselves so

I I see you know that's that's a big thing also in traditional medicine we go to somebody and they tell us exactly what to do and in ayurveda we invite them we teach them the practices that would be supportive to them but then we invite them to follow their own intuition right and they have to tune into how they're feeling and what they might need in that moment and how best to support themselves in that moment there's again I mentioned hundreds of ways to move our body there's hundreds

of ways to meditate so I could you know I'm not telling somebody you're going to do this meditation and move your body this way I invite them to what what feels natural and good to them what feels supportive to them like I don't like going to the gym but I'm super active every day I think I mentioned I go on these really long walks I dance I practice yoga I like swimming I like gardening these are all ways of moving my body that support me being in good health and well-being and have lots of

flexibility and strength and so on but I never set foot in the gym but if I were to go to a gym I guess I could lift a lot of weights or something because I'm really strong from all the other things that I'm doing so I always say like yoga will make any sport or activity that you're interested in doing it'll make it better but those other sports and activities like running or playing basketball or something those won't make your yoga practice better you know it's funny because I was watching a a video

on Netflix and it was talking about everywhere in the world where people live to be a hundred years old and one commonality exactly they don't go to a traditional gym it's just that their lifestyle is active and then in the US especially among my age group people are always going to the gym and you know obviously there's other factors but you know you're not seeing a long uh last on Healthcare obviously you know or on their health and their Wellness obviously going to a gym is good because

it's good to get the activity but if that's what feels good to a person and like I have a friend he's into riding the pelaton you know and he'll be like I'm in South America riding the pelaton and I'm like I'm out hiking in the woods you know if that makes him happy to to do the pelaton the the main thing is that he's moving his body every day and he's in his 60s and he's in good shape but that's what he likes to do I encourage people to you know like what

how did you like to move your body when you were a young person my dad said to me one day don't you think that's a little bit immature that you still go out dancing you know you're you know 45 years old or whatever now I'm 55 and I still went dancing and I even broke my leg and my knee last year and I was still out dancing for my birthday this year I had gone dancing my I broke my leg about a week after my birthday last year and by this year I was out dancing again when I had my birthday but that's

one of the reasons that um I heal better and like people are like I would never know that you broke all those bones last year because you move normally I had a really really hard time at particular junctures last year I was in a a cast and a brace I had a broken leg and a broken knee but I was doing all the healing modalities that I recommend for my clients what what happens when you have a broken bone lots of inflammation in the body right so I was taking turmeric black pepper and I was doing energy healing and I was trying to eat

nutritious food and drink a lot of water and ice myself and all the things that you do and I was still doing yogic breathing even though I couldn't do a full yoga practice I was in the the bed with my leg propped up doing leg lifts and doing like upper body movement and breathing I was still doing I was still doing meditation I just think that's like super important that you know we connect with how we like moving our body so I I told my dad you know what it would be weirder if just all of a sudden

one day I didn't like dancing because I've always liked dancing that would be really weird to me and he had to think about that for a second and he was like I guess you're right we'll have fun dancing I participate in ecstatic dance and I also lead ecstatic dance which is is actually a healing modality in its own similar to how Yoga Works you get that no mind experience because you're you're moving your body and you're able to like free your mind even forms of like exercise expression can be yoga is

an active form of meditation dance is an active form of meditation gardening walking hiking all those things can be an active form of meditation so you can get that whole body mind thing going on while you move your body so I always invite people like what did you like to do how did you like to move your body when you were a young person so Stacy's prescription for exercise for each person is unique to that person I'm not saying you have to go to the gym every day for 60 minutes if that sounds

horrible to somebody then don't go to the gym but move your body for 60 Minutes purposely every single day you know however that rolls out for you I like to be outside I like to be in nature arva does encourage us to get outside and connect with nature and get in in alignment and a tun with the with the seasons and we we even we detox twice a year going into V season and coming out of vas season we do detoxification and purification of the body you know so that's a very important aspect of being in harmony with nature

is that we actually get out in nature and we're actually eating the foods of nature you know and like what's in our local community moving our body eating healthful Foods meditating all these things I'm telling you they raise our energetic you know vibration or blueprint they make for us to be a more well-rounded healthful person I just finished a video working on the efficacy of icin and I've also you know looked into fenadol and you mentioned before cumin so do you use any off label drugs

in your treatment or any supplements any supplementation is done for me in my personal practice I don't do off-label drugs but I do um supplementation is plant medicine essential oil s are a very potent form of plant medicine I do work with those a lot and there's also a company called APL go that's originally from Europe they've been in the US for almost like almost five years now and since they've been in the US they have the number one immune support product in the market and those are all made from

plants and herbs that are supported by ayurveda so I really do like their products and those basically it looks like a little candy or something that you suck on what gives it flavor and color and so on is plants and they're made from essential oils and plant extracts I encourage people to use food as medicine and get get a lot of the um like I was mentioning before the turmeric and all those things the spices the herbs from their actual food but they can also be taken in supplement form so those um plant medicine works

best sublingual where you're um it's it's it's bypassing you're not swallowing a pill or a supplement that that has to go through the D ingestive process it's getting absorbed through like your tongue and then it hits your bloodstream within about 15 minutes of ingesting it and immediately goes to work that's how I recommend supplementation for people who need it I do obviously see a lot of cancer patients having worked at a cancer treatment center for the last 25 years I also just recently signed a

contract with another place called gildas club and they're they're all over the country but they have multiple locations in the Detroit area and they're a nonprofit they do not offer treatment but they offer support programs and education for their for cancer patients and their family members so I'll be doing again teaching people how to do energy healing uh teaching about essential oils teaching yoga and all those different support things meditation um so that's you know I do

see a lot of cancer patients but anybody that has a chronic sometimes people just call me up and they're like I feel energetically off or I feel like um I could be taking better care of myself and I don't really know how to do that but I'm very drawn to ayurveda right um so there's those people that don't necessarily have something wrong right now per se but they even feel like I was talking about like their energy they just feel like their energy isn't as high vibration as it could be and they

want to know how to improve that so there's people who are want who are healthy that are looking to stay healthy there's people I I work with people with all kind of different chronic things like Ms lupus diabetes heart disease cancer um I just had a guy talk to me last night about kidney disease all those different kind of things that are going to be impacted by having more healthful natural lifestyle choices or people that I work with so it's a wide range of people and I also happen to be

an ordained minister so a lot of people even come for Spiritual reasons you know they just feel spiritually off and they want to be more in alignment with nature especially in the US because so many people struggle with it anxiety heart disease is the number one killer in the US and Cancer's number three behind covid-19 it's so interesting when I even say the word ayurveda people are like I have no idea what that is they' never even heard of it so that's one thing is just lack of knowing right they just

don't have experience with it until I looked for options outside of traditional Western medicine I didn't know what ayurveda was either so it's I've kind of been on a mission all these years for educating people and a one of the things that I always say to people when I mention I'm in ayurvedic medicine they're like I have no idea what it is and I'm like I bet you you're aware of some of the practices of ayurveda and just didn't know that it was part of a larger system of caring for yourself so

then I start talking about yoga and meditation essential oils plant medicine seasonal nutrition Cadian rhythms you know stuff like that and then they're like oh I didn't know see they didn't know that that was ayurveda so people know little bit bits and pieces because that's what they've been introduced to you know tumeric you know toric's become my best friend uh since 2020 I mean I've used it so many times you know and even you know the rise in in herbal medicine people really love yoga so it's a great

point is that people really do know what it is they just don't know that it is ayurveda so my next question is what is Wellness to you and how does it apply to ayurveda well Wellness to me is being in Balance Body Mind and Spirit and that is exactly what a your Veda is you know Body Mind and Spirit what reviews have you received from past clients one of the things that I've noticed time and time again that I you know I'll have a client and I get lots of referrals to their friends and family

I appreciate that people are getting good results from working with me and more importantly that they trust the health and well-being of their loved ones in my hands as well and a lot of that comes from their experiences of Wellness I I had a a lady just recently interesting she's a a black woman from the Detroit area here and she had not and it was partly how she was raised but she had a distrust of people that were not from her same ethnic community and if she wasn't referred to me from a

trusted family member she probably would have never come to see me and because of her work with me and she she really felt that there was a space of non-judgment right and a and a lot of compassion that was coming from from the work that we did together that it has completely opened her up as a person she's now interacting with people outside of her immediate culture um she said she's parenting differently she has young young kids and um so that same distrust that she was raised with is like out the

window and she's like rethought so many things in her life and so she came to me because she had Cancer all her cancer numbers are improved all that good stuff and she's in remission and that's wonderful but she will forever be changed you know how she's moving about the world is forever changed how she's raising her children how she is in relationship with her spouse and all of that is forever changed because of the work we did and that's just a byproduct of getting IM balance you know I never

ask people to do anything that I'm unwilling to do myself I know how hard it is to make change right and that we have to do things in an incremental way and we build we build from you know what's most important to get us on track at that time and then move forward I came to ayurveda again because of my own health problems and that I make a concerted effort on a daily basis to walk my walk you know and talk my talk I I do the same practices that I'm teaching that I'm encouraging people to

do I try to be like a living example of what ayurveda can do for you you know I hear all the time like gosh you have so much energy and um vitality and so on and I really attribute that to what I learned from Dr Krueger all those years ago and to pay it forward and to educate people like it's my passion to help educate people because you know life is good everything's better when you feel good Body Mind and Spirit you know if you enjoyed this video make sure to click the Subscribe button and visit the

The goal of Ayurveda is promoting good health instead of fighting disease. The goal is to cleanse your body of undigested food, which stay in your body and lead to illness. The process is called 'panchakarma', designed to reduce your symptoms and restore harmony and balance. Other processes used are blood purification, massage, medical oils, herbs, enemas, and laxatives.`)}
