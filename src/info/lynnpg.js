and we are live. Welcome to our next episode of DECENTMED Spotlight featuring Lynn Mccintosh. Reclaiming your life and joy after toxic relationships. >> Hi everyone. Yeah, I'm Lyn Mintosh and I help people heal after leaving a toxic relationship with a narcissist. So, um, yeah, I help them heal and regain their joy and their life, get their life back. Yeah, my target market is uh women um anywhere from 25 to 65 uh that have been in a a narcissistic abusive relationship and they need help

healing. They are struggling. They are depressed. They are confused. They don't have clarity in their life. They are feeling not quite themselves. So, they need to they need to get out of this uh rut and they need the help uh to to come into their own joy and happiness again. And I have a three-month course called Reclaiming Your Life and Joy, which takes them through a healing journey um into from being, you know, depressed and not feeling good to feeling joyful, having confidence, having direction and

clarity in their life. and um getting rid of the narcissist, not worrying about the narcissist anymore. Uh their life is theirs now and they have control and they have confidence. And um I myself have been touched by narcissistic relationships. Uh the three closest people in my life were narcissists. So I was affected by it for quite a few years. And I decided to heal myself about 15 years ago now. And I couldn't I you know I'm so glad I did it because my life now is I'm doing so much more and I'm feeling so much

better and it's just a different life, right? Um so now I want to help others because um I help myself so why wouldn't I help others too, right? >> What is a narcissist and how can women tell if he is a narcissist? >> A narcissist is someone who's self-absorbed. They're manipulative. They're controlling. They uh have to be center of attention usually. Well, they do. They want to be center of attention. Um they dismissive. Um when you're in a conversation with

them, the conversation usually always goes back to them. It's all about them, right? Um usually everything's always about them. So, when you end up in a relationship with a narcissist, it's usually a one-sided relationship. Like one of my relationships, I may as well have been talking to a brick wall because they don't listen to you. They will talk. They want you to listen to them, but they won't listen to you. And you can be sitting there talking to them and you see this blank look on their

face. They're not even listening. So, it's not a reciprocated relationship where where normal relationships are reciprocated and we, you know, we give back to the other person. Uh there's there's there's you know one talks the other talks that you know it's like a reciprocated but this one it's just a one-sided and um you end up feeling um unheard invalidated. Um you know they leave you feeling after a relationship with say 6 months to a year you're feeling depressed. Uh you

wonder why this person can't connect with you properly. You know you're wondering um what's wrong? Is there something wrong with me? Did I do something? So all these questions and I know with me myself too all these questions came up like what what did I say that made them so upset like what did I do right and you start questioning yourself and self but that's what they want they want you to self-doubt they want you to question yourself so I went through the whole healing process and I

know I help other women and men too I have uh men clients as well I help them heal from this it's a it can be a brutal abuse I was on a a Facebook group last night. There was like 200,000 people in it. It's like a lot of people are suffering from it. I guess I have two W's or three W's. Uh my first why is I want to help people um that are suffering because a lot of people that I talk to that want to get help, they they don't know what this is. They don't understand. Like I fell in love with

this person, but the person that I'm with now, I don't even know who this person is. It's like a different person. So I want I want to help people um that are suffering and that are hurting to get out of this and to heal and to have give them a happy life because we all deserve a happy life somehow. So uh you know and and not a perfect happy but just we need to have to to to gain control and to feel like we have direction and clarity and we we have confidence a healthy confidence you know

um things like that. And I want to help people that are suffering because I know the I know how it feels. I went through it and it's just brutal. So I want to help others. And also I want to create a lifestyle um that is uh you know create a lifestyle where I can free to do things and free to um well I've traveled a lot. I traveled a lot when I was younger, so I don't really know about the traveling, but you know, just to be able to do things um with my my my grown children. They're now 28, 30, but just

be able to do things in life. I have the flexibility to be able to do this or do that or, you know, create this or create that. And um you know and do have a a business where it's flexible like um you know if I can't come come to one call you know I can I can cancel and we can have it another time whereas I did work corporate and it doesn't work that way you know you have to be there you so whatever but yeah I want to help people I know people are suffering these Facebook groups there's some awful and then

there's the pe young women that have children so if I can help a woman that has young children, what I can do is I can help her be a better mother and then the children won't go into this generational narcissistic because what happens is so you have a parent that's a narcissist, then you marry a narcissist or you're you're with a narcissist, then you have children and then they become narcissists. You know what I mean? So, I want to stop that um cycle and get the you know these mothers and and have them

be get healed so they can they can be a good healthy mother and not transfer this down to their children and it can stop. You know what I mean? >> Narcissistic personality disorder affects one to two% of the general population but traits are more common especially younger men with studies showing 7.7% of men and 4.8% 8% of women meeting this criteria. How do you think or what is toxic masculinity to you and how do you think that plays a role in narcissism? >> Uh toxic masculinity would be um wanting

to be in control. Um uh demeaning uh demeaning of their partner uh not giving them any credibility. Uh not giving them any recognition. Not listening to what they're what not listening to when they talk to them. um domination, >> right? Dominate dominating. >> Um yeah, all those fun lovely things that that uh they can do, right? Um manipulation. Um what else is there? you know, you're in a conversation with a bunch of people and you and him are in the conversation with these people, but everything you

say, he sort of dismisses and then he talks over you, right? So, things like that. Um, yeah. >> And how do women prepare themsel for toxic masculinity or how do they how is what is the defense towards it? How do you help women to defend themsel against toxic masculinity and narcissism? Well, to try to defend yourself, I don't know if that's the word because sometimes defending yourself, you end up so tired because these people just don't give up. It's they're they're wired this

way. So, um they don't really give up on what they're doing. So, I think what you should try to do is draw back. Um go less contact. Uh don't be as available. Um, you know, think of think for yourself. Think um, you know, think more for your own well-being versus always him. Think about your mental health and your self-care uh, versus worrying about him all the time. Um because if you start defending in yourself and in like it gets to be like a defense thing, you become very all you do is end up arguing

or you end up tired or you end up miserable, right? And this person isn't going to change. Like they're never going to say, you know, oh Lynn, I'm so sorry I hurt you. You know, like I really really am. I'm going to make some take some steps and I'm going to change and I'm going to become a better person. You're never going to hear that. narcissists will never say that. So, it's going to be up to you to and that's the crazy part is you're you're doing

the work that they, you know, but you have to do the work to heal and um yeah, just you just draw back and um hold your own space, right? Don't be so um don't be so available to them and um I think that's the better way. and you know, learn more about yourself. Like, start start learning about your, you know, your yourself and what makes you tick. And like that's the trouble with a lot of women. They're in these relationships with the man and he's taken over and they they just keep trying to, you know,

win this man. I What do I have to do? Why Why doesn't he listen to me? Why did he argue with me tonight? I I went out and bought that that birthday cake and everything. We, you know, I was all set to have the and he just was yelling at me. I did everything to please him and he's yelling at me. So sometimes trying to make it work doesn't work because they don't care. It's all about them and they don't care. So you have to sort of separate that and just say, you know what, you you do what you got to do and

I'll do what I got to do. And um that's sort of the better way to look at it. Yeah. So according to recovery village, one in 200 people have narcissistic personality disorder. >> So in your ex personal experience, how did that play out for you? What was it that they had narcissistic personality disorder? Were they just a straightup narcissist? How did you get out of that situation? Can you speak on that? >> Yeah. Well, I guess they were both. They had they were narcissists and had

narcissistic personality disorder. The one person in my life was not a full-blown narcissist. Um she had traits. She could be very loving, very kind, very um funny, very generous, um you know, and and nurturing, but she could also be controlling and demeaning and um manipulative sometimes and sometimes gaslighting. So, but she wasn't a full-blown like there was both like it was half and half. Whereas the other two people in my life, I'd say were full-blown. Well, my friend became full-blown as she got

older. And not just with me, but with everyone. She be you you saw the narcissism come out in her. And um when she combined that with alcohol, it was like, whoa, you're lighting a match. So anyway, um yeah. Um, and the other person in my life is called a covert narcissist. And a covert narcissist is someone who to everyone they appear to be like like super this, super super dad, super father, super, you know, does all the great things and and and is knows everything and, you know, always got it together. But behind closed

doors, they can be very controlling, manipulative. Um, don't play fair. you know, they don't play it's all about them and what they want, not about what you want. Um, covert narcissists like they can, you know, they're like they can be pillars of the community, right? They can be, um, you know, they show up into the public like this great person, but behind closed doors, not. So, um, and it can happen in families, it can happen in professions, it can happen anywhere, right? But yeah, so um and

there's the covert narcissists, there's the malignant narcissists, there's the um well then you can get into the the heavy duty stuff. Well, I don't do psychopaths and sociopaths, but that's the other end of the spectrum because narcissism is on a spectrum. I go you can go from up to the the beginning down to the end. It's on a spectrum. So, um, yeah. And I know now since I've educated myself, I know when I see a narcissist, I can tell over across the room or when I'm in a

conversation, I know right away this person is a narcissist. God bless. Chains. Yeah, it is literally chains. You feel like you're being hauled by chains, you know, like it is cuz you feel like and you feel like you're wrapped up in chains because you feel so uh not yourself. You feel so uh controlled. You feel like walking on eggshells, like walking on eggshells, you know, like you better careful what I say. Better not say that. He's going to yell at me, you know, walking on eggshells. Um yeah, you're you're you're

in chains. you're you you know if I take if I walk if I do that he's going to freak out you know or oh I better not go out with my friend tonight he's going to freak out at that too right and um yeah you're you're wrapped up in chains like you just feel so controlled and so miserable right and all your confidence is gone the joy that you used to have you know the the things that you used to love to do all that seems to dissipate and go away and you know that's not we don't want that.

So >> and we're a holistic health platform and you mentioned underneath this sentence that what causes is stress anxiety and a ail and a myriad of other ailments. So how do women get out from the stress and the anxiety utilizing your program? Yeah. Well, I um when I was healing uh before I became a coach, this was long before I became a coach. When I was healing, I started to do self hypnosis. Um he's on YouTube. Um and I really liked what he was how he his voice, the way he did the videos. Um you know, you

just lay back and all you have to do is lay back, listen, and gradually my my body would relax. my mind would would would go into like a um I'm still I'm still awake. I'm still, you know, totally there, but you just start to relax and your mind starts to relax. And um I found after listening to a couple of these videos, I thought, "Wow, like I'm feeling a bit different, you know? I'm feeling happier. I'm feeling uh peaceful more, you know." So I did this for about 6 months, 8 months every day.

And um I thought, you know, this is working. So I thought, you know what, one day I'm going to become a certified hypnotist. So I did. I waited about a year or two and then I went and got my certification for hypnotism. And I incorporate that into my program because you need to um you need to reverse some of the things that have been going on. You need to come out of that hyper state or that depressed state. And you need to come out of that and you need to come into a state of peacefulness,

a state of confidence, uh a state of uh well-being, you know, a feeling of well-being rather than feeling like when am I going to get attacked, you know. Um and that's what the hypnosis does. It helps you to um just, you know, to center yourself. It made me much happier. And as I as I developed confidence and became happier, I connected with people that were um that would would would hold events. So they would say, "Lyn, I you're becoming a coach. I love it. Like come and speak at my event." So as I was improving my

mindset, I was improving my relationships and I was improving um my my life. So I I made connections with friends and some friends whether they were successful like helped me, you know, um connect with other people that helped me grow uh my business as I was growing it back then. Um and um yeah, it was all a win-win, right? Um because people can see if you know what the vibe that you let out to people is what you're going to get back, you know, and if you think about it, it's true, right? So, um, if you're giving off a a

confident, sort of happy, uh, open vibe, that's what you're going to get back. And if you give back a, um, mean, sort of like controlling, I don't care attitude, then that's what you'll get, too. So, yeah. >> And I love how you said that because the body has an immense regenerative potential to heal itself. And something that we foster is collaboration among other members of the holistic medicine community. When you look at traditional medicine, they refer each other. A

gynecologist will refer you to a podiatrist, to a pediatrician, etc., etc. But in our space, you guys don't do that. So one thing that we are trying to foster is ways in which hypnotherapists don't see each other as competition but instead they see each other as referral partners. So, someone that's on the platform that I definitely will introduce you to and I want you guys to both do a meeting like this together is Sarah Green of Green Hypnotherapy and did a study >> helping women or helping nurses pass

their nursing exam because they had test anxiety. So it goes back to the anxiety utilizing that subconscious reprogramming to change your subconscious because our subconscious is saying negative things >> from a mindset coach on our platform Priscilla >> that 96% of what we do comes from that subconscious >> 4% comes from our conscious brain. >> That's great. Yeah. >> Our subconscious as you mentioned earlier is filled with stress. is filled with negative selft talk, negative

belief, whether it comes from narcissists, whether it comes from parents, whatever it may be. >> So it really is changing that mindset. So that's how corre is how you help these women is that they are told I'm not good enough. >> Exactly. >> Lovable. Changing that subconscious to no I am lovable. I am capable of love. So, what kind of reprogramming do you do for these women? >> Well, there's a my my course is a three-month course, and we we we start with I don't want to talk too much about

it, but I'll talk about it. Um uh present. We start with their present. So, there's four modules dealing with no with their sorry with their past. There's four modules dealing with their past. We have four modules dealing with their present and then four modules dealing with their future. And each module there's different things that that they do or uh sort so to say. The very first uh call is all about them. Of course, it's them t telling me the story of how they met the narcissist, how

they're feeling. Um what's gone wrong in their life, you know, what they want to what they would like in their life. Um it's a whole zoom call for an hour just about them and um you know and I so I can get I get I can gather a picture of what is going on with them and getting then having each each client has their own individual um plan of healing because you know everyone has a different experience and everyone has a different personality. You can't just put one with you know it's we're all

different. though. Um and then we we go we go into their um they talk about their past. They talk about um you know fears they've had. Um what what brings them fear? Um why are they always feel that they're afraid you know um things like that. And then the second uh second one the present then we start into the healing process. So, we're going to start into um acts of we do acts of kindness or gratitude. We do the hypnosis. We do the self-care like go out and go out and get a makeover, go

out and and and and get a massage. And it's not just as simple as that, but we do do um quite a few things in the present module in the present section that um helps them to also um build up their confidence again. and feel good about themselves again like wow like look what I did today I feel great you know and as they as they build up this confidence they start to lose that connection with the narcissist and that's what of course what happened to me you know as you start to build up your confidence and you start to get

happy and you start to feel good about your life the narcissist starts to dissipate out of your life right because you're feeling better so um you know and then the next module is the future so then we talk about what they want in the future like their future relationships, what they want them to look like um with family, with friends, career, do they want to up their career, do they want to do something else? Um what changes do they want to make in their in their life? Um you know, because a lot of times when people are

in a toxic relationship, a lot of things have gone by the wayside. You're in this relationship and it's dominating your head, right? and you know, you're invited to a party with a with a bunch of girlfriends and it's like, "Oh, I don't feel like going tonight. I just not in the mood, you know, or you you you get a job promotion at work and, you know, oh, I'm not going to worry about it. I just don't I'm not into doing more work. I'm going to just forget about

it." So, these narcissists suck the you know, they suck so much away out of you. And I'm trying to help people to get this back because they can't be in control. You know, it's just not right. It's just not right. No. >> And those titles are so powerful. Releasing your past, >> reclaiming your present and re-imagining your future. >> Circling away from that. And for anyone interested, you can access this course at reclaiming your lifeandjoy.com. >> So, what is self-care? You you touched

on it briefly, but what does that mean to you? Well, self-care can be physical things or it can be also mental. It, you know, it can be spiritual. You know, going to a retreat, that's self-care. Um, the hypnotism is self-care. Anything for your mental health. Um, and you know, mental health is we need self-care for our mental health as well. Um, yeah. Um, true retreats are great or going um, you know, going going out like tonight I'm going to go meet a group of friends. We're going to go out and karaoke and

dance and just have some fun. And I go out once a month. I I party and I have a good time. And that's good, very good therapy. You know, you're you I love to dance. I used to to dance and and you know, you're having fun, you're laughing, it's it's it's spontaneous. um you're letting you know you're letting your hair down a bit and I come home and I feel happy. I feel I've connected with pe with friends and things like that. But then there also can be physical things like um maybe

going maybe you need you know through the through the the bad relationship you've let yourself go. Maybe uh you know your hair has all gone gray and you know your your your skin is all starting to sag. And I know with me when I was going through it, I all of a sudden I got this huge rash on my face. Like all of a sudden I woke up with this red rash right here and it was from stress. And so stress can be a real bummer, right? So yeah, going um getting a makeover or getting a massage uh going

for a back massage or a full body massage or going to a sauna um you know and then um I don't know jogging like doing things like I I swim every second day. I I do lengths that's therapeutic for both the body and the mind, right? And I I have friends there. So, doing things that um you enjoy, right? And sometimes doing things that you would never do, like that's that's really good because you know, oh, I would never do that. Oh, well, you know what? I'm going to try it. Why not? and like trying

something new, you know, um, anything that brings you joy or happiness, you know, like makes you feel good because the narcissists the narcissist doesn't want that at all. So, yeah, there's a lot of things, you know, it's mental and also physical. U, but I have quite a few things in my course that they can do because I've I've tried a few things myself. And that's why I love what you said about reclaiming your present. You know, I find really interesting. We have a practitioner. She's an ayurveetic

physician and she her her dad was saying, you know, Stacy, why do you always dance? And she said, "Dad, don't you think that it would be weirder if I just one day said, "I don't want to dance anymore. I hate dancing." So, like you said, it really comes back to reclaiming your present. And that boils down to what self-care is because you lose a sense of yourself then it like you said brings stress. You know I I saw something online that it said that the number one cause of death it comes from

stress. You can eat healthy, you can do everything you can, but if you have high stress, it's going to lead to death. And when you look at all of the blue zones where people live to be a 100 plus years old, they have community. >> Yeah. Can you touch on how you build community among these women? >> Uh, well, I'm I've started with like I'm doing a one-on-one coaching, but I want to eventually get into the group coaching because I think with what I do, group coaching would be more beneficial.

I think with when you have a group of say eight women, uh, we have a Zoom call and about a certain subject, you know, you're going to get different feedback from different people. this person had this experience and this person had that experience and then oh you went through that now how did you deal with that oh okay that would help me or gee I never went through that how how do you do that so when when you have like a group um like I do the one-on-one and I would probably continue with the one-on-one

but I think the group would be great because you're going to get more feedback and and get more ideas coming out right um from other people that have gone through maybe the same thing or a different things. So, um, and I know when I post, like I'm I'm a moderator of eight groups or an admin of eight groups in Facebook. I was invited to be I guess because I I post every second day and it is a passion. Um, this narcissistic abuse thing. It is a passion. It is my my my go-to, right? Um, and I love to to

do posts on it and I love to capture, you know, the pain and then to come into the joy and to get people to look at that post and go, "Wow, you know, and I do I get PE, Lynn, I that is so right on with me. I just went through that and you know, and trying to help them to see that, you know, someone understands and can help them come out of it." So, um, yeah, I'm in Facebook on these groups and these women that are in a lot of pain. Um and um you know I was uh just before CO I was speaking uh in front of um I work

with a speaker storyteller and he helped me create my story and I was up just before co like in front of uh groups of people talking about my story and how it affected me and this and that and I'm sort of a private person and and Jason says Lynn don't worry about it people aren't judging you when you say your story they're going come up and go, "Wow, that's exactly what I'm going through. Give me your card." Or back then it was we had business cards. Give me your card, Leno. Let's get to I want

to talk to you. So it and it also Jason said, "Every time I tell my story, I'm releasing more of the pain. I'm letting it out." Right? So, I was I was uh speaking um a few years ago and I'd like to go back into that uh speaking in front of groups because when you get up and tell your story, people when you look at the people in the audience, they're just like, "Wow." And then you get them coming up and going, "Lynn, like my friend is going through her husband is just awful and I need to help

her." like you know and it's so nice to see that they can resonate and understand that what I went through they can get they get it right and they want to help either themselves or other people right so yeah and I couldn't agree more especially what you said about the group coaching because people need a friend and when you're coming out of of a toxic relationship ship being alone. It can be the worst thing. >> You know, some of your goals, you said that you want to start speaking in front

of groups. So, my my last question and then I'll circle to the summit is what are some of your goals of 2026? >> Well, yeah. I was actually out of the blue a few months ago, someone um he invited me to do a TED talk. Do you want would you like to do a TED talk and get yourself out there? Right. I'd love to do a TED talk. Um, and that's in my future. I would love to do a TED talk and, you know, share what I know about narcissistic abuse. And if anyone in the audience I can help um or give them

points or anything, that's all I want to do. Um, I was invited to speak um in Spain. I think I will. I was invited to speak in Spain next uh February. Um I'm invited to be in a um woman on fire um uh summit. I'm invited to be in that and it it it goes to in April. There's a virtual one and you can also go down to Trinidad in Tobago. There's a you can go live. It's a live one also. I was invited to be in that. Um I was a co-author. Um Jim Britt was Tony Robbins first mentor back in the day. and Jim

Britt and this other man um they're publishers of this book called The Change. And I was on Facebook. They messaged me, would you like to be in the change? There's as a co-author. And I said, "Wow." Um sure. And she says, "Listen, we we're looking at your material. We like what you do. Um you're helping, you know, you have the goal of helping others." Um I said, "I definitely do." And she said, "Would you like to be in it?" Jim Britz the one of

the publishers and um Les Brown who's a famous world famous motivational speaker is uh does the forward of the book. So I became a um co-author in the change last year. Um I was nominated woman of inspiration Canada 2020. Um there was other women nominated but in my niche I was nominated. Um um I was um a co-author of two number one international best-selling books on empowering women to success. Um I'm invited on to podcasts which I love to do because I love to meet you know like with yourself Sam I love to

meet new people and it's an experience and it you know we're each helping each other. Um it's it's great. So yeah, um I like this too because I get to do things that are, you know, that are fun and meeting new people and, you know, it's a growth thing for me too. You know, I'm growing, you know, and each one I each person I coach, I'm also growing and I'm also sort of coaching myself because as I coach them, I'm coaching me too, right? Because I'm I went through it also. So yeah.

Yeah. So, it's it's all uh it's all good, right? >> 100%. Just looking at statistics, you're in the right field. Holistic health for women shows high engagement with alternative/digital wellness, strong desire for integrated health, but significant disparities exist. With women facing higher rates of anxiety and depression, which you help with, one in five women are affected. And just to you, you know, thank you so much for for doing this interview because some of your goals, they all can be addressed.

Decent Med's going to help with that and and it's just great to have you. >> Thank you for for what you've done, too, Sam, and you're, you know, your passion of what you're doing. It it shows through and you're doing such great things and, you know, you have so many different people on your on your team there, like all different kinds of doctors and homeopathy and everything, right? So, it's interesting. >> Yeah. >> Because our goal is similar to some of

your goals. We want to have, >> you know, we want to have group coaches where people come in and get coached by Dr. Kristen Barnes for their trauma and then, you know, speak to you about helping them with their anxiety. Speak Sarah Green and and you are creating a package together with hypnotherapy. As far as international speaking engagement, we're already working on an international summit in Surinam and we want that to be very big. We want to fly all you guys out. I've already spoke

with a tour guide who's willing to give you guys tours of Surinam. >> And you know the final thing is you said that TED talk because people are shifting away from pills and towards natural medicine. >> That's right. know where to go. And that's why your TED talk is going to be extremely valuable because people need to understand what is narcissism, how to look out for it, >> how to prepare for it, and then how to heal from it and live an abundant life. >> Yeah. Because uh as I said, a lot of the

people when I talk, they don't know what it is, and they don't understand why they're in it. Like, and I feel so, you know, here I can help you. I can I can fill you in on what this is, you know, and and you can get help and you have to but you have to want to help yourself. Uh there was one girl I talked to about a month ago and she she um she was interested, but she says, "You know what? I I love him and I'm going to just give it a bit of time. Maybe some, you know, so eh you have to be then you

get I get people that listen, I'm all in. I'm ready for the change because this is a big deal. you're you're changing your life. You're getting out of this relationship and you're you're going to have to up your game, right? So, it's it is work. My course is work, but I try to incorporate a bit of fun in it, too. So, it's not all serious all the time, but it is work because you're you're helping to, you know, gain your own identity again and work towards a

healthy mindset and um healthy lifestyle. And it's work, you know. Um, some people are lazy and like, "Ah, okay. It's too much work." But, you know, if you meet the right people, they're right into it because they're smart. And they know that to be in a narcissistic relationship, where will your life be in a year from now if you stay with this narcissist? Where will it be? It's not going to be it's not going to be any much better. It's probably going to be worse, right?

So, yeah. And it's like digging out of a out of a hole. You know, when you're in a narcissistic relationship, you're deep down in the hole. So, obviously, it's going to be a lot of work to dig yourself out of it. But once you get out of it, now you have an abundant future. >> So, ladies and gentlemen, Lynn will be speaking at our decent meds summit. Our decent meds summit is called Experience Vitality. These are our current speakers. We have a nutritionist, a ayurvedic physician, our chiropractor,

two trauma specialists. He helps trauma with men. She's a naturopath that helps with trauma with women. We have authentic life journey, which is a uh she's an empowerment coach. We have a spiritual healing coach, mindset coach, a general or this is our advertiser, Happy DNA Candy, Green Hypnotherapy, which I speak at speak spoke about briefly. She's a hypnotherapist. Thrive Results Coaching is a health coach, essence of life as a functional medicine doctor and then another advertiser. So

Lynn, just to close, what are you planning on speaking on on this topic regarding experience vitality when it comes to overcoming narcissism? Um, I'd like to speak about um the damage that uh the narcissist actually does do to you and um understanding what a narcissist is so that you know why they're do why they do this because for me sometimes it's like why are they doing this? Why are they so miserable? Why? Why? Why? Understanding what a narcissist is and why they do these things. Um and

understanding why you're feeling this pain, why you're feeling, you know, this way. And then um showing you like what needs to happen for you to have a better life, like what you have to do to heal. And you have to want this. like as they say 90% if you have if you have the desire for something that's 90% of it right there. >> So you want something you've got 90% covered right there. So uh just and helping them understand you know when you do heal how much better your life will be and how much

more things come into your life. How um you know your life is fuller your life is more meaningful. Your life is your own. it's not someone else's. Um, yeah, just just to go from what a narcissist is to the damage they can do and how bad it can get and then coming into the healing and what it will bring you when you heal. That's that's what I like to talk about. And I think that's what's the main things, right? What's important. So, >> Len, thank you so much for joining me

Any final closing thoughts? >> Oh, I just want to thank you, Sam, for everything you're doing to uh to get us out there and um meet I'm I'm looking forward to meeting other other people here and you're doing a great job.
