  const txt = `She's an actual MD in functional medicine. We do have a functional medicine nutritionist on
0:06 our platform, but it's great to have a functional medicine doctor. Hi, I'm Dr. Nadia Taylor. I love
0:12 this space. I love what you've created with decent med. I'm definitely all about wellness and
0:18 getting to the root cause of things. I trained as an alopathic medical doctor. I have done a lot of
0:26 pharmaceutical prescriptions in my 23 year plus career, but I got to a point where I felt that
0:32 I was not doing the best for my patients, and so that's why I transitioned over into
0:38 holistic functional medicine, because I really believe that the power of natural medicine
0:45 and supplements to help the body heal. And if you take away factors that are toxic to our body
0:55 and give it the right nutrients and supplements that the body can heal itself.
0:59 You have essence of life. I really like that name. Why did you choose the name essence of life?
1:05 It's kind of multi-fold, yeah, multi-fold reason. One, I really believe again in the essence
1:19 of our bodies being able to heal itself. And honestly, a few years ago with COVID, when COVID
1:29 hits initially, there were so many people that were getting sick and so many people that were
1:36 searching for answers. And I really found that there was a lot of healing power in essential oils,
1:45 and I used that personally for myself and my family. And so I decided to name our group
1:53 essential wellness because of the power of essential oils. And then I started taking care of a baby
2:01 that her mom is very holistic and really wanted to give her daughter the best
2:09 environment from the start. And that baby's name is essence. And I fell in love with a baby
2:15 and so when I decided to name the center, I decided on essence of life for those reasons.
2:22 And I think it just captures the heart of what we're doing. We are able to prescribe pharmaceuticals
2:30 if needed. I still have that prescriptive authority, but our main passion is to use natural medicine.
2:39 And I really believe that's the essence of life, not depending on something that's made in a
2:45 big factory somewhere, a big pharma. It's really using natural products to help the body heal.
2:51 As you brought up essential oils, you know, one that I love is rosal oil. I know that you
2:56 can blend each Florida and I know you have a variety of services. Can you unpack who's a target
3:02 market? What type of ailments do you typically see on a regular basis?
3:07 It's twofold. One, given my experience in pediatrics and caring for, again, really holistic
3:16 families that want to limit preservatives and anything that's not natural in their children.
3:22 A lot of these families are vaccine-friendly. So I do see kids that are on that path where the
3:30 parents either don't want vaccines or they want to severely limit what they give to their children.
3:37 I support that. There's some pediatricians that believe that you should get everything
3:41 on the schedule, and I'm just not one of those. So I love seeing my young kids and helping them
3:48 live a holistic life from, you know, early on, from infancy, from birth, really.
3:54 And then the next target market, given my experience in blood diseases and cancer,
3:59 and also personal experience with people that have been affected by cancer that are close to me,
4:06 I believe in supporting those clients and helping them to use alternative medicine to support
4:15 their healing. So that's a key market that I'm looking to help people heal from. That's cancer.
4:27 Definitely not giving chemotherapy. I'm going to let the patient decide exactly what they want to do
4:35 with that, but even if they decide chemotherapy, chemotherapy is so grueling and hard on the body,
4:43 we can help support that if the patient chooses to do that or if they choose to do the
4:50 natural route. But essentially, our cancer protocol includes fasting the body and helping the
4:59 body to get metabolically healthy, because cancer can only thrive in an unhealthy environment.
5:06 It's a sign that your body is somehow deranged, like it has gone off of the path rate, and it's
5:13 not controlling those cancer cells, because normally everyone experiences a controlled growth
5:20 at some point, but your body's immune system checks it. So we're supporting the immune system
5:26 by giving high doses of IV vitamins, helping the body to optimize the immune system and also detoxing
5:36 the body. And then just providing information, we also have a hyperbureg oxygen chamber,
5:44 which does help with cancer, as well, cancer grows in a low oxygen environment. So if you can
5:51 hyper-oxygenate the body, that will help the cancer cells to die. We also have light therapy,
5:56 red light has been shown to be important in cancer treatments. Conventionally, I think we're
6:02 behind the eight-ball, like that is new information that's not really been instituted, but if you go
6:07 to PubMed and you look at the NIH's database, you see that there have been quite a few studies
6:13 that show that. So it's a multimodal approach to help the patient have the best chance at
6:20 beating cancer. Research on PubMed indicates red light therapy can inhibit cancer cell growth
6:28 and increase cell death and laboratory settings, with some studies shown reduced tumor growth
6:34 and improved survival rates in animal models. We brought up starving cancer, and that reminds me
6:40 of the book How to Starve Your Cancer by Jane McClellan. And one thing I've learned when it comes
6:47 to whether it's Dr. Sebi and so many other doctors, that's one thing that they are keen on,
6:54 even with Dr. Max Sphererson as well, is the idea of fasting, and composing a fast with what
7:01 you're doing, then when you bring up hypervirate oxygen, so we have a chiropractor on the platform,
7:07 Dr. Tess Walner, and she utilizes hypervirate oxygen as well. But can you walk a novice stool,
7:14 what hypervirate oxygen is, and what that process looks like?
7:18 Okay, so the hypervirate oxygen chamber has been around for years,
7:24 primarily it's been used in wound healing, because if there was like a decapitus ulcer,
7:31 something like that, an ulcer on the body that was having trouble healing, that's when
7:39 conventional medicine would prescribe the hypervirate oxygen, so traditionally it has been only used
7:46 in like very highly specialized areas. So essentially when you use hypervirate oxygen,
7:54 you're hyper oxygenating the body, and you're creating these reactive oxygen species
8:02 that can again kill the cancer cells, also helps your body detox very good for the brain, provides
8:13 a rich oxygen environment that makes the cancer cells die, they won't grow in that environment,
8:21 because they like low oxygen tension or environment. So when you increase the oxygen level and
8:29 the blood throughout the tissues and the body, then the cancer cells die, so that's the crux of it.
8:36 Can you speak on sugar and how you work with your patients regarding sugar?
8:43 One of the most I open things for me as a judicial medicine doctor that we were never taught,
8:50 like the effects of sugar on the body and on cancer, so cancer, that's like the preferred
8:58 fuel for cancer's sugar, so that's one of the first things that you want to do is to
9:04 basically cut out sugar so that you can start the cancer cells, and fasting so that your
9:13 your body will utilize the fat stores in the body. A lot of toxic chemicals are stored in the fat,
9:23 and so as you cut back the sugar and start metabolizing that fat in them itself will help your body
9:31 to heal and kill off the cancer cells. So yeah, definitely getting your sugar down low-carb diet
9:39 is key, I believe, to helping your body fight cancer and also prevent cancer. So that's one of our
9:47 main things, that's why I have a nutritionist on board is because I believe that's so integral
9:53 to everything that we do is what you eat and what you don't eat, and fasting is one of the most
9:59 healing things that you can do to your body and help to regulate and get your body into a healthy,
10:06 a healthy state. It seems like traditional medicine fails to acknowledge the benefit of a nutritionist
10:16 when it comes to cancer and rare disease in general. So what percentage would you attribute to
10:23 diet and lifestyle? At least 80%, right? So we in the functional holistic medicine world,
10:29 we talk a lot about epigenetics, right? I think epigenetics is huge because it says that even if you
10:37 have propensity for cancer, if there's something in your lineage, you can overcome that with diet
10:46 and lifestyle. So that's 80% of your healing definitely has to do with what you do or do not put
10:55 in your mouth. So that's huge. And again, I think that traditional medicine is lagging in that,
11:04 and a lot of people are realizing it. I actually have two people very close to me that were essentially
11:13 diagnosed with cancer around the same time. One of them chose the traditional route with chemo
11:20 and surgery, and you know, I told them other stuff, I sent them other stuff like
11:27 natural holistic stuff to support what they were doing. The other person, even though they had
11:33 a workplace, they met with a radiation oncologist, they did their research, they decided to get
11:38 to go a more natural route. As it turns out, the person that chose the traditional route
11:46 went downhill real fast, and the person that chose the natural route, which includes the
11:53 apricot seeds, fasting, you know, taking a whole bunch of supplements that support the body.
12:01 That person is still doing well, and as far as we know, the cancer is not advanced. They are so
12:07 anti-medicine, they chose not to do any more scans. So we're not sure exactly. We don't have
12:15 objective evidence at this point as to what happens in terms of the cancer, but we know that
12:21 symptomatically they feel great. They have great energy level. So that just helped me to see the
12:26 power of the natural medicine and the natural route, and I'm here to support people that
12:32 that want that. 100 percent. It's about life, extension of life, but it's about
12:39 quality of life as well. We go back to our summit. It's experience of vitality. What is vitality,
12:46 and how do you help your patients experience it? So yeah, that's a great, great question.
12:54 And I think for me, a lot of it comes from my personal experience. Again, I went into medicine
13:00 to help people, to help heal people. I felt like I was called to cancer from a very young age.
13:07 I used to watch the, I think it was the miracle network, like fundraising, the funds that they
13:14 would have, and I would be like crying, looking at the cancer kits, and then my own experience,
13:20 training, and caring for kids in the hospital with cancer, and looking at the diet, and I would
13:25 walk in the room sometimes looking at a kid, you know, going through chemo and eating a hamburger,
13:30 and having fries, and thinking, okay, there's something wrong. You know, we need to give them
13:36 more real food that has, you know, real nutrients in it, not dead food. And then honestly, I think
13:45 the biggest thing for me, it has been my own journey. I was diagnosed in my 20s with a breast
13:54 tumor, turned out to be benign, but just a sign that my body was kind of off, also diagnosed
14:01 fibromyalgia in my 20s, and I went to quite a few doctors, which at the time I was in med school,
14:07 some of them were my professors, and I really looked up to them, but rarely did anyone ask me about
14:13 my diet. It was actually a nurse practitioner, but I saw that pointed out that have you, like,
14:21 taken a food diary, and have you been able to correlate, like, what you're eating to how you're
14:26 feeling, and that was like, real eye-opener for me, because truly, I did notice a difference when I
14:33 did it eat certain things that felt better. So for me, vitality, and all my labs, I should say,
14:39 a lot of traditional medical doctors will focus on labs, and they're like, oh, your labs look
14:43 fine, but really they're just doing like superficial labs that don't really get at the root cause
14:48 of things, like looking at your micronutrients. And so for me, it's not just about health,
14:53 but it's about wellness, and vitality, and giving yourself real food, and helping your body,
14:59 to just be at its best date where you feel like your mind is clear. You can think you have energy,
15:03 like I felt like so many years, I was in pain from joint pain, I was like very sluggish. I would
15:11 say I had chronic fatigue at some point, and I did do some tests that weren't traditionally done,
15:19 for one, I found that my vitamin D level was super low, no one had checked that on me for years,
15:27 and then I also did some heavy metal testing, and other micronutrient testing that gave me some
15:34 insight into what was going on in my body that helped. And then also a few years ago, I was having
15:41 some neuropathic pain, and a neurologist actually screams me, and I found out that I have
15:49 something called monoclonal gemophathy of a determined significance, which is really just a
15:54 deranged immune system. And so I really thank God for that diagnosis, because that helped open
16:00 up my eye, so that's a potentially precancerous condition, and I've been able to keep my levels
16:05 really, really low, just from diet, I don't take any medicines, I just take supplements and vitamins,
16:11 and again, I'm almost 50, I'll be 50 next year, and I feel great, I feel better now than I did
16:18 in my 20s, because I'm very mindful about what I eat, and what I put in my body, and again, I use a
16:24 lot of these modalities that we have here, like I've used the hyperbattergots to gem, I've used the
16:29 red light, and I feel great using it, and so I just want other people to experience that,
16:35 as you said, that vitality, it's not just about being alive, it's about feeling well while
16:42 you're alive. We want to do individualized plans, like we don't want everyone to have the same,
16:51 plan, like everyone is different, but at baseline, yeah, we want to do some micronutrient testing,
16:59 looking at some key vitamins, hormones, and minerals, before we institute any recommendations,
17:07 but across the board, in my experience, taking care of patients, some key things to look at,
17:14 vitamin D3 metabolism, iron metabolism, magnesium levels, a lot of us are magnesium deficient,
17:23 zinc, selenium, those types of things, and just looking at markers that may help us decide if your
17:35 body is having trouble detoxifying, and then once we have those baseline numbers, we can give
17:42 recommendations as supplements that can help your body to detox and also restore those core minerals
17:49 and vitamins to a healthy functional state where you feel well. I can say anecdotally,
17:57 I find that patients that are holistic in their approach and their view in natural medicine,
18:04 in my view, are healthier and experience more vitality, and even from the standpoint of kids,
18:11 I can say that one of the things that really helped to change my trajectory in medicine was when
18:18 I started caring for families that didn't want traditional vaccines for their kids, and we're
18:25 very intentional about what they put in their kids' bodies. I noticed there was a huge difference
18:31 in the health of those kids. I saw less asthma, less eczema, less ear infections in those kids,
18:39 those kids were just healthier in general, and so one of the things I want people to know is
18:48 vaccines are essentially a pharmaceutical product, and so if you're a holistic and natural,
18:55 be very mindful. I teach people a lot to look at ingredients, including in vaccines. If you
19:01 decide to do that, I usually provide a list of what is in the vaccines, and that in and of itself
19:09 is very eye-opening, and I think very helpful, but yeah, I think generally we need more research,
19:16 and I think RFK, I don't agree 100% with all of the politics, but I believe he is definitely on
19:24 shining light on some of the gaping holes in our vaccine system that the pharmaceutical companies
19:32 were able to get away with. They didn't have any accountability, right? They put all these vaccine
19:37 combinations together that have never been studied together, and so we're giving things that,
19:43 when you look at the insert, they tell you, okay, you can have this, this and that, but then we
19:48 have doctors saying, oh, it's 100% safe, but is it really? So yeah, I think there's a lot of work
19:57 to be done still in that space. The search in general of the state removed the mandatory
20:03 requirement for schools for kids to be vaccinated, which I think is a step in the right direction.
20:09 Again, I think it should be parent choice, it shouldn't be mandatory. If you decide that you want
20:15 that for your child, then I'll support you, but if you decide you don't want that for your child,
20:21 I don't think you should be forced to, so I support that as well.
20:26 Completely. So just briefly to show you what a study does look like, because I think a lot of
20:32 providers get this confused on what this would mean when you say a study. So this is an example of
20:39 a nutritionist study. This is a lot more dissertation based because you did it in college,
20:44 but if you look at this hypnotherapy study, for example, it's not as comprehensive. It really is
20:53 titled a study, whatever the background of the client was, whatever you gave to help the client,
21:01 and then maybe two slides on that. In this case, it was this study right here was,
21:08 people couldn't pass the case. Tell me what your why it is, and what are your goals in 2026?
21:17 So those are great questions. I think my biggest why is just helping to give people hope.
21:26 I believe that we all have a calling on our lives, and I think that's one of my
21:31 callings is to bring people hope, and that's actually what my name means. It means hope,
21:35 Nadia, which is an Eastern European Arabic in the origin, but that's what my name means.
21:41 And so all of my life, I've just known that I'm here to help people. Part of my mantra is
21:49 living a life of service for the betterment of others. So I feel like whatever feel that you're
21:56 in, your life should be to help other people. That's why we're here. I believe in a higher power,
22:03 and I believe in a calling. And so, yeah, my why is basically my calling, and then the
22:08 health experience that I've had, and people close to me have had, that I've just discussed with
22:13 my own health, and others close to me. Just seeing the power of natural medicine, I just believe
22:19 more people need to have access to that. And when I walk around and look at people,
22:26 and I know this maybe that they have a gut, like instead of judging, I have a compassionate heart,
22:32 and I'm like, I want to help that person, because I know long-term, you know, we know the
22:39 the signs that someone's metabolically unhelpful, and they're at risk for
22:45 determinative diseases and cancer and all that. And so my goal is to to help prevent
22:51 those complications by helping people to get more the balladly healthy. And if they have those
22:56 complications, help into reverse some of those conditions with nutrition and lifestyle. And I
23:06 really believe that's like the, it has so much power. Just using nutrition and lifestyle,
23:14 that's really the key to what we do is helping people recognize that and empowering them to
23:21 make choices that will optimize their health. So I think a lot of times in traditional medicine,
23:27 we have this paternalistic view, like we're going to tell you what's wrong with you,
23:31 we're going to give you this med. Yeah, you're going to have this side effect, and we're going to
23:34 give these other meds a mask it, but in functional and holistic medicine, our goal is to empower you
23:39 to educate you and to give you the knowledge that you need to make choices at home that you're
23:46 going to be your best provider. You're your best health care provider if you know your body better
23:51 than anyone can. So really empowerment is a huge why of mine. My goal in 2026 is just to expand
24:00 what we're doing now to be able to help more people and to, yeah, just to see this reach more people
24:09 and educate more people and see more people be healed. Particularly speaking at our
24:17 DecidNet Summit on 1212, should be a part of our roundtable, which I'm very excited about,
24:24 because as you see here, we have Laurie Graham, the natrified alive who I want to introduce you to,
24:30 we have our Ayurvedic physician, we have our chiropractor, we have Jim Paconin, and Dr.
24:37 Kristen Barnes who are trauma practitioners, Jim is a coach, and Dr. Barnes is a natural path.
24:45 We have three types of coaches, empowerment, three-day spiritual healing coach from India,
24:50 and she's a mindset coach. We have our green hypnotherapy, which is a hypnotherapist.
24:56 We have a thruive results coaching, which is a mutual genomics coach, and then obviously essence of life.
25:02 So we have a number of providers that all have a different take on vitality and a different take on
25:10 health. Dr. Taylor, if you want to call by, just, what are you planning on speaking about at this
25:16 summit? I'm excited about the summit. I'm excited to speak to other holistic providers. I think one of
25:24 the key things that we need to do is to collaborate across the board. It's not only about my practice
25:34 and what I'm doing, but also just giving people more information, more options. I believe in, you know,
25:42 acupuncture, and sometimes even hypnotherapy if you need to release trauma. So yeah, I'm looking
25:51 forward just to the collaborative conversation that we'll have and the knowledge that we'll give
25:56 people and the empowerment that will come from the summit. So I'm excited to be a part of it.`
